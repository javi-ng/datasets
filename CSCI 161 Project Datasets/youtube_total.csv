Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"So many comments saying how wonderful the performance was. I have to disagree. I like Tottenham but, they played against 9 men, one of them reds was questionable at best, lfc had a perfect goal wrongfully disallowed - and own goal won Tottenham the game in the final seconds - ultimately almost losing to 9 men with provably wrong ref decisions throughout. This is not a good measure of performance. This not an attack, happy for you to win the 3 points etc good result but worrying performance not good at all"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,Only thing better than winning in extra time is watching the complete meltdown of fans from every other club.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"How VAR can get it that wrong on Liverpool's denied goal is shameful. They said they saw there was no offside but validated the on-field decision by saying 'check over' (although the linesman had raised his flag so wouldn't the on-field decision be 'no-goal') and the ref interpreted the 'check over' as 'offside'. Then when the game starts again supposedly VAR cannot do anything? Really? Don't they talk to the ref? Couldn't they have simply said, when they saw the ref give a freekick for offside: ""No mate, we meant there is no offside you may award the goal?"" So embarrassing!"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"On the Disallowed Goal...  As much as this a human error, it is not an individual official's error. If we take the emotion out of this and spare the poor officials - this is a simple problem and has a simple solution. Challenge me on this.  ---Problem is in the process: Taking this particular instance as an example: A particular decision was being checked by VAR.  It is open to interpretation whether... - the OFFSIDE was being checked or  - the GOAL was being checked  What was actually shown on the screen - 'Checking for Disallowed GOAL - Offside'  Ultimately, the decision relayed was CHECK COMPLETE.  Hence, depending on what you thought was being checked, you could interpret the decision accordingly as well.  ------- ---The 100 million $ Solution: ------- VAR officials to show the ultimate decision post the VAR check... in the below format  Ultimate decision (Reason)  GOAL stays (Not offside) Or GOAL Disallowed (Offside)  The above to be vetted by both 1st and 2nd VAR officials before the decision is displayed.  These kind of things take time and should be allowed adequate time. Time to be taken on average by VAR (provided the right angles and pictures are available on the spot to the officials) -1st VAR official to make decisions - 20 seconds (max) -2nd VAR official to review decision - 10 seconds (max) Allow for a 10 second consultaion, at the end, with the onfield referee. Total time taken - 40 seconds (max)  Possible other improvements suggested: - Allow for VAR audio to be available, to make things more transparent   What say Spurs???"

They managed to score a second goal which would be any club's bloody job with such support from the refs and they shouldn't have celebrated at all, but just continued to play the game against a team that was so obviously robbed. But Tottenham was so relieved that they lost all honour when they managed to put a second ball in the net. Why not a third, or forth red card as well? Perhaps a fifth to help Tottenham score a third. Then they could have talked about how the game was a rout. But this game was a bloody shame, decided by an awful team of refs. I expect Liverpool to protest against being forced to meet both a normal opposition plus a crew of refs that should front a poster for Specsavers.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"""Today marks the darkest and most heart-wrenching day in the history of the Premier League! In the fierce battle between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, the referee, the linesmen, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), and even the rules for issuing yellow and red cards, were all manipulated as tools to unjustly skew the outcome of the match. The wrongdoers merely have to utter a casual 'sorry', and then everything is supposed to return to normal?! Where is the integrity in this? Where is the professionalism?! Can you honestly say that the players on the pitch were treated fairly? Can you face Liverpool and the global audience with a clear conscience?! From the perspective of Tottenham Hotspur fans and players, I am absolutely certain they feel no joy, they only feel that they were unjustly treated. The only ones possibly gleeful are those who bet in favor of Hotspur and made a fortune!"""

Jones is clearly trying to murder Bissouma and that could have get him injuries I hospital for 2 years. Same for Jota who did dirty on Skipp last year. Also Gomez should have get a red card on his horrendous tackles. Luis Diaz goal is almost onside but actually that’s offside. But it doesn’t matter cause that football is fair and they didn’t deserve that goal after those brutal foul. Diogo Jota and Curtis Jones should write a letter to apologise referee and spurs players for the tackle and a 100k fine. That would only give our players justice cause we were clearly robbed when deluded fans are acting they are “fair” and speaking bull shit 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

The var applied and you, Tottenham, played Liverpool with only 8 players after the team was out, you weren't able to, but in the end it was an own goal. It was created to be the difference in this match. If only Luis Duiz's goal was confirmed by the cheating referee, maybe you wouldn't be able to beat Liverpool. Remember, karma will pass. Tottenham, you won not because of the game, but because of Var and the referee. Don't let the referee pay you for this match. Tottenham. Hotspur is truly a scandal"

This is why Son Heung-min can never play full-time, and why Son Heung-min is removed through manager Enze if it seems like he will score more goals.

We have such a hard time against teams who drop their lines. We need an answer for this quickly.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Son Heung-min is a weekend and dawn for Koreans. It is a being that makes the end of the week and at the same time makes another beginning.  Before Son Heung-min, many Korean players challenged for the European stage and made great achievements, but those things Separately,  Son Heung-min's career is at the peak that Koreans can show on the European stage.  Especially when I see him becoming a legend of Tottenham as he enters the Premier League, I feel proud because he seems to be sharing his history.  If Park Jisung opened a new dawn for me, Son Heung-min is making history at my new dawn.  I want to say something of support to Son Heung-min, all Tottenham players, and staff, Also, I want to continue to watch and cheer for Tottenham in the future, along with countless Tottenham fans.  My dawn was fantastic again today."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Yes, the off-side decision was wrong .. yet it was really rear for Spurs to get some help from refs in a recent EPL history..while many cases refs were so favorable to Liverpool or Manchester teams.and I respect all Ange's tactics but dont understand why he pull out Son early. and give a full -time for Klusevski.. he is the one who makes slow counter-attack and couldn't make a good cross from a side.. and pulling out the team's top scorer in that must-win situation ..."

Rồi khi phải thi đấu với 9 người thì họ chuyển sang phòng thủ rất bài bản và chặt chẽ, 1 ngày thi đấu đầy cảm xúc nhưng có lẽ định mệnh đã không cho họ được hưởng 1 chút niềm vui nho nhỏ. Bàn phản lưới thục sự đen đủi tuy nhiên không ai trách Matip cả. Một trận đấu thật sự rất hay các cổ động viên cũng rất cuồng nhiệt luôn cổ vũ hết mình cho các cầu thủ dù phải thi đấu với 9 người. +1 respect 🔥🔥"

Could have been Sonny's chance to be the undisputed Liverpool killer for Spurs today. Kept getting subbed out regardless of how well he plays. I get that Ange probably has his reason but it's just not right taking him out when he is 2 goals in and looks very promising to score his hat-trick. I think Tottenham could've secured historic 3pts at Emirates if Sonny was kept in. Tottenham went full pressing to being pressed as soon as Sonny's counter attack threat was gone. Tottenham's attack looked boring as soon as Sonny got subbed out today as well. At this point, we can all tell that the class between Sonny and Richarlison is too grand. Should've subbed out Richarlison for Solomon instead of Sonny."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Liverpool fought well, but in the end the result was right and hard to give a performance with 9 Players on the field, apart from the VAR mistakes....""AGAIN"".  Unlucky with that first booking, which led to a second booking and that sending off, nothing wrong with the Jones sending off, if Gusto was sent off for what he did, this one was identical and I and others would have been annoyed if he had not been, then there was the goal that should have stood.  Week in and week out, mistakes by a VAR Team.  Not just subtle mistakes, but ruddy great glaring ones.  There is nothing wrong with VAR, it works perfectly.  It is the Monkeys in charge of it, that is the problem and always will be until they do something about it.  You begin to wonder if they are being paid off by whoever, the mistakes are so blatant.  Then you get, ""Ooops! Yes, sorry, mistake was made"" and yet nothing is done.  No answering for that mistake, no punishment and it really is not good enough.  We had an incident just the other week, where a VAR Official played ""The Old Pals Act"", admitted it and nothing was done about that either.  How much longer are we, the Fans, the Players, Managers, Clubs supposed to put up with this incompetence, before something is REALLY done.  Once again VAR Officials spoiled a really good game."

I can understand your anger but the arrow needs to go to that VAR referee not to Spurs.  We had good game against each other, and Liverpool showed real class with that 9 men defense. It's sad that this good game had to be remembered in bad memory with this messy VAR scadale."

Lol small team mindset , nowander such teams don't win anything , you should be going after your team for not beating liverpool in a better fashion ...... if madrid performed like that on our home ground , we would have booed our team .. no doubt ....."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"To be honest, we played better against 11 men Liverpool then against 10 or even 9 men Liverpool. It's cause they started sitting deep, and we don't have the players to really break through a team that sits deep. But in the opening of the game when Liverpool weren't sitting back, we actually looked really threatening and dominant."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,The Refereeing reminds me of that Chelsea vs Barcelona game... horrid
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Liverpool were the true winners in this match, if I was being honest. 1 man down for most of the match for an unbelievably dubious yellow card at best but a red card was a disgraceful decision & all you Spurs fans know it. An obviously perfect onside goal from Liverpool disallowed and another red card later on in the match was very questionable. Spurs should have hammered Liverpool but only got the points due to exceptionally bad refereeing and unbelievable VAR decisions. Disgraceful."

Then he can get close to Gakpo to try and stop using his body. Sarr is youngster so maybe its difficult but he could also say to Bissouma to pick him up. Still need a leader in defence i think it will be Van De Ven but needs time to settle into the league because they look a bit green in defence,also the keeper is new as well so he could have shouted its 3 on 2 there. Well done Gakpo for a great goal there. That was Kane levels. Great game to watch"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,Haha. LiVARpool fans paid the ref and still crying like a kid 😂😂😂. Jones is clearly trying to murder Bissouma and that could have get him injuries I hospital for 2 years. Same for Jota who did dirty on Skipp last year. Also Gomez should have get a red card on his horrendous tackles. Luis Diaz goal is almost onside but actually that’s offside. But it doesn’t matter cause that football is fair and they didn’t deserve that goal after those brutal foul. Diogo Jota and Curtis Jones should write a letter to apologise referee and spurs players for the tackle and a 100k fine. That would only give our players justice cause we were clearly robbed when deluded fans are acting they are “fair” and speaking bull shit but the ref is clearly against us😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Ok, I see you Liverpool fans being mad at this situation for Luis Diaz's goal being offside, as a spurs fan watching the match live, I also thought it was a clear onside. Also, the red for Diogo Jota should not have been stood, since the first yellow card was not reasonable. But as a spurs fan, the first red was a clear red, which could have made Bissouma in a big injury. So, if it was to say liverpool got the first goal and there was only one red card, I think we would have still won the match, since when liverpool were down to 9 men, all 9 men went down defending to keep the tie, that's why spurs struggled until the last minute of OG to win the game, but if liverpool had 10 men they would have kept the attacking position which could have lead spurs for an more easier attacking stance against liverpool defense, which in my thought could have lead to more goals maybe 3:1. Finally, liverpool fans, even though it was a controversy win, we won, and it is not the player's or the fans fault, it is the referee's so go blame them, and also remember the last minute goal was an own goal by your own player."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,마라도나도 우승하기 위해서는 행운이 필요했다. 운이 따를 때 기회를 잡아야 한다.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"All the debate around the whole thing with the VAR calls is a bit silly.  Humans have a well documented habit of attributing important reasons to things with important outcomes. We’ll speculate about prominent assassinations for centuries or longer, but hardly bother thinking about all attempted assassinations that don’t amount to much. We have a hard time accepting that things that feel important happen for random reasons. It makes us feel insignificant and not in control.  In the mind of the liverpool fan, there’s either a conspiracy, or they got robbed by a flukey bad day at the office from the VAR officials. One of those feels more satisfying. One of those is easier for folks to swallow. But it being easier to believe and more soothing to the psyche doesn’t mean that it’s a take with any particular bearing in reality.  The backlash is exclusively because of the perception that this ‘changed’ a result. And the increased speculation too. Personally, I think that Allison had a ridiculous game and Liverpool are lucky to not have given up 4 or 5. If the final score line was 5-1, the discussion would be very different."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,Good video and success football My friend 😊❤
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,Fraud by FA and Referee.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Even I'm a fan of Tottenham, I still feel bad for that own goal.."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"imagine barely winning at the last minute through an own goal after facing against a 9 man liverpool team on home grounds, and if it werent for the VAR mistake it would've been a tie despite all that"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,Bissouma And Maddison dominated that midfield
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Yes the referee was shocking and ruined the game, but everyone acting as if we're this lucky team that gets all the decisions is just so out of touch, we're literally suffered from so many bad decisions during all these years, let alone against just Liverpool. When other teams get decisions it's the referee's fault but when we get them (for once) we suddenly are the evil guys that corrupted the officials lol"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,The thing about VAR is one team will always benefit from it hence there will never be enough outrage to remove it completely from the game. Personally I think they should do it how it’s like in cricket where you get a certain number of appeals to check VAR
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Tottenham,"Fair result, the only dubious thing is the offside. The two reds were deserving, should of gone sooner with that elbow to Romero's head. Remember Pedro Medes against utd, Cost Tottenham champions league football, cost Martin Jol his job. What about lasagna-gate, Scudemore was at the Highbury when he took the call?. About time another team tasted Spursy factor. Enjoy x"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Liverpool were incredible playing with such a high tempo with reduced numbers in terms of the two red cards.   My verdict; more red cards should be dished out especially to players of the top clubs. They tend to escape punishment at the expense of the smaller clubs.   Stepping on the foot of another player is a no no and should be given 5 bans. Football is a game played with the feet, and stepping on another’s foot can be a career ending dangerous tackle for some. The rules should be hard on offenders when stepping on another’s foot or hacking someone’s leg as Toti did to Balotelli in Rome some years ago."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Tottenham celebrated their 2-1 win against Liverpool. Not realizing that they were being assisted by the Referee and VAR officers who were working together under the pretext of blaming each other. Additional penalties against Liverpool for red cards and yellow cards from the referee must be re-examined, whether they are fair or not. It could be that due to the influence of Liverpool's goal it was deemed invalid because it went out side in the 34th minute. The Premier League, which is greatly admired by world football fans, still has referees and VAR officers who are unfair."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"THE FIRST GOL LUIZ DIAZ NO OFFSIDE,,LOL VAR,,,,"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,9:28 what a punch by Alison. Monstrous punch!
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,I'm a Spurs supporter and Diaz's goal should have been awarded but not our fault. There have been so many of these incidents over the years including for Spurs. If this game is going to be replayed or result changed then we need to replay or change every dismal VAR decision that has gone against every team in the past. The only way to fix is it to get rid of VAR totally which means Diaz's goal still wouldn't have stood or actually have a proper review protocol so that every decision is checked with the technology not just the ref's assuming.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,why Matip always scoring own goals tho?
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"What an incredible game. The stadium, the teams l, the drama, the mistakes were all incredible. Any fan at the game for either team are extremely lucky to have been part of it all."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,we need more of Darwin!
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"As a neutral the only clear error was the offside.   The Jota first yellow looks innocuous but his knee catches udogie as he intersects his run which causes him to trip himself   2 mins before jota’s yellow card he cynically brings a spurs player down and was a potential yellow card anyway.   2nd yellow was cynical and no need to swing a leg. Definite red card  Jones red card was unfortunate but still resulted in studs up and could’ve ended bissoumas career, with a leg breaker. Correct decision   So basically Liverpool fans are irrate about an offside decision. But making out it’s “corruption” and “EVERY decision was rigged etc”  I bet no Liverpool fan moaned when the ball hit Sissoko’s armpit in champs league final"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,We was robbed.  Dias clearly scored a ligit goal.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"The most disgusting officials in football history. Never a human error. Fixed game. Corruption. The moment the ref realised that diaz goal wasnt given, he was lost. Simon hooper lost his focus, he gave 12 cards in this game."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"The officials admitted their blunder on luis diaz's goal... But can points be awarded to liverpool? If points can be deducted from teams, why not points added? Idiotic refs... had the goal been allowed, it will definitely effect the outcome of the game"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Should be investigated for match fixing,   1. Jones false red card, his foot touched the ball first, it was unintentionally hit the other's leg 2. Luis diaz goal was on-side 3. Jota false first yellow card. It was a clear dive by a clown, even neymar will laugh for that.  4. Sorry to say, but matip also need to be investigated. The way he kick the ball just a simple striker kick to goal, he intentionally kicked the ball, not to make clearence.   I lose half of my respect to matip, not because the mistake, but the way i think he was a part of that match fixing.   Really need to investigate all of those points"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Simon Hooper, the referee of the match betweenTottenham and Liverpool, is the same referee who officiated the match that Liverpool lost to Manchester City, and Liverpool had not lost before that in a number of matches. It seems that he just wants to appear in the media against Liverpool. He issued six yellow cards to Liverpool players, in addition to two red cards to Curtis Jones and Diego Jota. He also canceled A goal for Liverpool, and we all remember his attack on Robertson at Anfield. Such a referee and VAR will ruin the greatest and strongest league that can be watched in the world and he is destroying LFC's chances of winning the league while also making sure Utd, Spurs and City dont lose out.The FA should have the game replayed losing 3  points that way could wrongly damage liverpools season."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Luis diaz onside
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I am only speculating but, I wonder if the Luis Diaz ""offside"" goal had really been allowed whether the flow of the game and the ultimate scoreline outcome would have been different than it turned out. Whenever one team scores, what often happens is that the team that has been scored upon has to eventually decide to play more purposefully with the aim of trying to even the score, if they initially fail to equalise without upping the tempo of their game. I know that Spurs has come from behind on many an occasion this season, but typically when a team does have to play catch-up football and purposefully up their own tempo, it has the potential of creating space on the field thereby making the game more open and as a consequence, the team who does this becomes more vulnerable to the opposition's counter-attack, which is something you do not want to see happen with Liverpool's pace up front."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Refill stupid

But Tottenham players and fans say Tottenham won a huge victory and the team is so good. And he mocked the Liverpool player who lost, telling him to go home and cry because he lost.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Let’s be reasonable about this. Every team has suffered from these errors and also benefited. To ask for a replay is ridiculous. How far do you go back? I don’t agree with VAR simply because it hasn’t eliminated human error as advertised. Go back to the old way and take the rough with the smooth. Should we ask for the arsenal game to be replayed because nketiah should have been sent off. No!

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"That was a good performance but one thing that I just can't understand. How could the VAR referee forgot to draw the line when checking the offside or not situation? I mean that was your daily job and that was so simple. There are only 2 possibilities for VAR. If you check the foul, just zoom and search for better angle and then if you check the offside situation, you just put the line to check it. Just 2 simple SOP and you forgot about that? That was shameful excuse i think."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I won't talk about Matip as he is not the problem.  Firstly, for Curtis Jones's red card, the ref went to a screen with a frozen image of Jones's boot over the ball on the chin of Bissouma, meaning the ref already have an idea what to do even before watching the whole action. Secondly, those muppets at PGMOL definitely should be sacked as they are paid to do a job and they didn't do it.  As for the performance of the lads even though we were reduced to 9, we were by miles far better than the Spurs. Liverpool played with the heart. That's why we are the best team and that's why we support Liverpool. I almost forgot, how ridiculous is the the fact that VAR is not used at the early stage of the Carabao Cup!"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"This performance had SO MUCH to cheer about Our Reds showed RESILIANCE, the subs have been IMPACTFUL, Ryan Gravenberch's entrance today had nothing to compare to his entrance two matches ago. He showed protection, skills, conservation, strength, intelligence.   We guys actually can reach top of the league... yes City is big but City isn't invincible, and we are difficult to beat as 9 men.  Guys we ALL BELIEVE IN YOU  Matip you had a belter of a match, you've been so solid, so sad that it had to bounce on you to go through the goal. But we have nothing to complain about you  YNWA <3"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,นี้นะหรือผู้ตัดสินแห่งพรีเมียลีก ไน้ความสามารถที่สุด
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,It's normal against 12 players
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Jones foul was unintentional, he played the ball, not the other player, he stepped on his ankle, but absolutely not with full strength. It's a yellow card, who knows football rules know that. Too bad the referee is an absolute amateur...Jota's first yellow is controversal: foul from the back is a yellow, if not intentional,it's a  free kick. Those retarded in the VAR transform bravely a yellow into a red card, but not able to do what is their main job: check offsides. Poor mentally ill, absolutely incompetent people there..."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Robbed by the refs again 😤
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,I see Jones's foot over the top of the ball through the entire sequence. At no point is he primarily contacting the ball. Red card is reasonable.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Referee made all the wrong calls. Jones foul looked alot worse than what it was, Luis Diaz's goal was onside, Jota's first yellow, he didn't even touch the spurs player. I'm not even mad that spurs won the game, because it was gonna be a tough match either way, they tried and we tried with 11 men, but hopefully this game highlights the problem with referees, officials and var."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"If Darren England and the always filigree Dank Cook, sitting in the VAR room, knew that Díaz's goal was valid and legal, why didn't they tell Hooper to listen, man, you were wrong, Liverpool took the lead even with a man advantage. At half-time, Colonel Hooper must have been told that the goal was valid, but he still hit the Liverpool team with another penalty and in addition forced 6 minutes of extra time at the end so that the Tottenham players could finally score the winning goal against nine men, but even that it didn't work out for them either. The blatant cheating hurt me because even with 9 men, Pool played better football and the capital city could only win with an own goal. This match was easily winnable and now the reds would lead the table. Instead, they take fourth place. Therefore, Darren England and Dank Cook should be banned for at least one year and fined for the damage caused to Liverpool. The request is not to decide the final result of a rally in the VAR room. Is that such a big ask?"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Hope this won't negatively affecting the momentum that liverpool was/is having,,  It took Spurs home advantage,, doubtful sent off x2,, rule-out of a non offside goal,, 1/3 playing with 10men,,1/3 playing with 9men,,an own goal,, to defeat this Liverpool!!!

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Respect to you Liverpool. The refs and VAR were a disgrace and the way everyone’s lauding spurs for what can only be described as sheer dumb luck the whole season so far, is a joke. Your fans are true supporters, and deserved at least a draw. I’m an Arsenal fan so I have my bias but spurs are going to have their luck even out very soon, even though I can agree they have improved and are more fun to watch now. VAR is truly ruining the game, they pick and choose when to use it."

The age of referees needs to be younger, and education for older referees needs to be strengthened."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I just realize after the aftermath that the referee gave Liverpool EIGHT yellow cards in this game, and Jurgen Klopp is right, they aren’t exactly a kicking team.  The officials’ bias in this game was evident for all to see and the terrible decisions should all be reviewed and analysed.  It’s not enough to say ‘significant human error’ and just move on; not good enough for premier league level…maybe Sunday league.  In my opinion, it was so bad, that the game should be replayed.  I even think some of the spurs fans might even agree because it was a rigged contest from the moment Curtis Jones was unfairly sent off.  I realise Alisson got a yellow card for time wasting which was harsh as well.  so did Salah after getting the ball off Boussouma when the Tottenham midfielder fell over in pretence without being touched ...I think Salah kicked the ball away in frustration because he would have been clear through on a goal…but did the referee even whistle before he did so??"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,VAR was put in place not to penalise teams unjustly because of human error. In this case where is the famous line which they draw on the screen to say that the decision taken is right. Where is it?  Show it. The team of referees and the VAR team should be banned for lifetime according to me. The  FA must take a firm decision to show that it is still reliable and credible. This match should be replayed. Had I been in the place of Mr KLOPP I would have insisted for the famous line to be put on the screen. I would have called off my players and invited our fans to invade the pitch then I would have seen how the game would have continued. It is obvious the the referees are mingled in betting.

But it’s was still kind of close so just for the sake of the viewers you should still show them. And for the red cards I cba even getting into that, I’ll end up punching my phone before I finish typin. I just can’t let this go how are we meant to forget about this and move on, it’s a joke.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"It is true that refereeing errors affected the course of the match, but the coach also committed the following mistakes, according to the consensus of football analysts: Poor selection of the starting lineup.  Mohamed Salah was left alone in front of three defenders without support from his teammates, and the coach had to partner Nunez alongside him in the attack.  Player Tzoboslai failed to add value to the team defensively and offensively, with no goals scored since the beginning of the season  because if his lack of speed physically. Repeated defensive errors in the team for seasons with the absence of a good right defender.  Poor changes in the second half and the removal of all attackers, which caused pressure on the team and conceded a goal.  Losing today means losing the championship because the competition is intense and we consider every point very valuable."

No point at all to investigate after the game and no point at all to remove the official after the match, no point because all has been Game over! It takes a period, 4 years or so.  And for fouls, sometimes it is the opposition player that perform the foul, where the force and charge towards the play, you try to dive and fall.  P.S: More ridiculously is offside.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,0:37 Is there offside really????
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Tottenham was extremely lucky today, having the refs with them and seeing Liverpool being robbed of a goal and being reduced to 9 men. Wrong team won, I think one has to be completely biased not to agree on that. What it concerns the refs, they were suitably dressed in black as grave diggers should be. They buried the game for us in a way I lack words to explain. I have rarely seen such a one sided focus from these referees who were so obviously not up to the task. For the ref just brush off Garcia's goal as offside without a proper look at the situation, makes him a hazard to have on a pitch. My absolute feeling is that he wouldn't dare to take such a sloppy decision in front of the Kop. The man hasn't the necessary courage to be ignorant of the press an audience like Anfield has. My point is that this crew of refs had judged things differently on Anfield. It's a damned shame that having the referees deciding the outcome of a match. No one can't claim that it's what happened. The way Tottenham celebrated our unlucky self goal in the dying minutes of the game, show also that this was the only way they could luck up our defense. Since they couldn't do their defender man to man, they were never able to get behind our line of superb defense. They needed a lucky strike and they got it. As a Liverpool fan with some of the European nights behind us, I would be the last man denying that luck has nothing to do with it. Of course it has. Sometimes you need a goal like Tottenham got, even if it was against 9 man. But it was how Liverpool went down to 9 men that's the interesting point here. I have seen brutal, brutal games between Chelsea and Liverpool or Barca and Real Madrid and no one has been given the red card. Football is a contact sport. Let the gravediggers take that aspect of the game away and you end up with 2-1 to Tottenham. 🇸🇪❤️🔴👍🆗"

We play away against a hot team, we lose a player due to poor call (or at least, a freak of luck accident), we have a goal disallowed due to one the worst VAR mishaps in history, we concede a goal first, AND we lose another player.  And only a last second own goal can beat us.  This team is very very hard to beat.  Only a perfect storm of incredibly bad luck and refereee incompetence can cost us games.  Our 10 men were easily as good as Tottenhams 11 men.  In fair fight, we stand a good chance of beating anyone, including Manchester City.  So, feel good about this game.

Stats are there and they show how each team has been affected by VAR since its first use. And some people still calls us LiVARpool.  As well as stats, the issue that is overlooked is key component to VAR- competence of the human operators. The tech is not the issue. It is the incompetence of certain people  using the tech. We can get rid of VAR but it does not rid us of the incompetence by on-field officials. That line official was in line with Sallah and Romero and clearly saw Diaz is onside!!!! He raised his flag after the goal, not when the pass was made. This suggested VAR intervened!!!   I don’t care what decision they make to withdraw VAR or keep it- but if you still have incompetence onfield, you have solved nothing!!  Assigning incompetence to a key system  and on the field is what is killing the game."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"As a Spurs fan, I feel bad for Liverpool. Diaz’s goal wasn’t offside. Apparently, for VAR, the lines were drawn, but VAR refs thought the goal was given on the field, when actually wasn’t. And they said check complete. However, since field refs said offside, they thought it was actually offside so the goal wasn’t given. There’s clear explanation from SkySports. I also think the ref was very biased. And your defending w 9 men was very impressive."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Barring the offside Liverpool are not quite there yet, discipline is shocking, moan about the reds but the 1st one is a red in today's climate & Jota is a disgrace doing that with 10 men already on the field.  Matip has faltered at the end of nearly every game he's played this season hence replaced by Konsah near the end in 2 games, fatigue set in hence the own goal, yes we played honorably but there's an issue with discipline & no CB in the summer means we short in that area. We move on but Klopp must address the constant red card issues & get into players heads not to recklessly tackle once already on a booking!"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Proud of this team
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,The worst part about the offside decision is that Klopp complaining about it publicly would get him fined. Whatever it took to keep him calm...
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Spurs fan here.  The game should've ended in a tie.  I don't think the ref did that much wrong.  The first red card, could go either way on the call, but the only reason people are saying a yellow is ok is because Bissouma didn't get hurt.  The first yellow on Jota was light, but it was a cumulative call from his two previous infractions that could have resulted in yellow.  Jota's second yellow was a yellow period, he should have been more careful knowing he already had one.  Liverpool with 5 in the back with all their midfielders dropping back were disciplined, leaving very little space to exploit.  The own goal is unfortunate, but we had a player waiting to hit it in the net if you watch the replay even if he misses the ball.  Also, we have had our share of our goals and terrible calls so far this season.  Anyway, Liverpool played well and it should have ended in a tie, with Diaz's goal being onside.  Klopp handled things well."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I think the game is unfair, the referee is cheating, paid by the home team, the first card of Jota has no touch on the opposing player, the home team only takes advantage of the situation to trap Jota. Where is the var?? while Diaz's goal is invalid because of offside and the saddest var is not shown fully as if to cover the truth of the goal is legal and deny the goal is not legal..the game is not fair.the referee seems to be bribed by a third party,tottenham's victory is dirty and unfair ..the referee should be investigated and action should be taken accordingly. suspended. the referee is untrustworthy and unfair."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Why would Luiz Diaz's goal be counted as offside? It really shows how bad the officiating was. It was an absolute shame on the game of football. The fitness and stability of EPL VAR officials and referees should be properly  checked before assigning them the responsibility. Last night was horrible in the history of English football. The events completely eroded our confidence in match officials. They may want to watch the game again and again so that they will know the extent of the damage they have done to their reputation. Really despicable.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Well played lads YNWA❤ I really hope Matip doesn't lose his confidence from that unfortunate goal...he was a force to reckon the whole match alongside VVD💪

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Absolute disgrace that the Diaz goal didn't stand. This game just goes to show how ridiculously low the general refs level is and VAR is a joke and a liability. I suggest we make a league where Refs can gain and loose points depending on their contribution to the game. Good Refs get good games and bad refs will fight for relegation. Make ""mistakes"" like this and it should cost you your job. Atleast for a while.   A good ref can make the game flow beautifully - but a bad ref can literally ruin a football match. I feel so bad for Liverpool and its fans. Tottenham are not to blame for anything tho... Unacceptable."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"٠Simon Hooper, the referee of the match between Tottenham and Liverpool, is the same referee who officiated the match that Liverpool lost to Manchester City, and Liverpool had not lost before that in a number of matches. It seems that he just wants to appear in the media against Liverpool. He issued six yellow cards to Liverpool players, in addition to two red cards to Curtis Jones and Diego Jota. He also canceled A goal for Liverpool, and we all remember his attack on Robson at Anfield. Such a referee will ruin the greatest and strongest league that can be watched in the world."

Tsoboslai, unfortunately, did not provide the required addition since the beginning of the season, neither in creating an attack, nor in seizing the ball, nor in scoring goals.. We have been suffering for years from individual defensive errors... The changes were also not appropriate and caused us to accept pressure from the opponent because the coach  Take out all attackers."

Replay the match as football is suppose to be played not with this nonsense VaR which rules out goals for no reason and allows the ref to red card willy nilly. Get a grip fire the officials and rewind the game. Hugely controversial, referee you resign with immediate effect."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I have never seen such a corrupted match in my life. Full of human ""errors"". Come on reds keep your head up. Herr Klopp is proud of you for a reason!❤"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,TottenVAR
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,The MOTM was the VAR
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Jota's first yellow wasn't even yellow - if you watch it back Udogie trips himself and falls over. It's very clear on all angles and all footage. When I watched it live and when I watched it back both times there wasn't a single bit of contact. So even if the second was yellow (which it probably is), he shouldn't have been sent off. Yes, he's being silly, but I think that first unjust yellow card is definitely affecting his emotions. Crazy to think that Liverpool should have ended that game 2-1 up with 11 men. Simple solution here really is to just implement what tennis does - once a half, if the manager thinks its a wrong decision he can ask for a check. If the check overturns the decision he gets his check back, and if it's wrong then he loses it. Some of these decisions are clearly human error and a second look would have overturned them."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,THIS WAS THE BIGGEST ROBBERY I HAVE EVER SEEN!!
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Congratulations Liverpool. As an Arsenal fan I am happy of your spirited efforts.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"It's unfair because Liverpool have never taken any of home advantages given by generous referees for an home team so far. So Tottenham don't deserve it, either."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Never have I ever been so proud about a lost game.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,No way those are red cards. And the game should be 3-1 for the Cops.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"My deepest condolences from an Arsenal camp. We feel you, since we still remember very well last season's match against Brentford, when we conceded a goal from the man who was like half a meter in offside, but VAR ""didn't notice"" it. The match ended 1-1 and we were literally scammed by 2 points by completely unprofessional people in VAR room. This whole system need to be reformed ASAP, at this stage it is simply a joke."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"What's clear is that at the Liverpool home stadium, Enge won't let players run like crazy dogs like Kloop's."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Jota let the team down.He was the only player who did not show up , did not fight and did not take it seriously. Liverpool will win this game anyway if Diaz goal wasn't choke of by corrupt officials ( they cost Liverpool already two Premiership titles against plastic City ] , but if Jota was doing what every one else was on the pitch we will win this game with in  the second half even with this non existant red card and choked off brilliant strike by Diaz .Jota let us down."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,How was the Diaz goal offside?! He was level.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"As a Tottenham fan although I am happy about getting the three points by facing one of the best teams in the world, I must say I am also heart broken for the woes committed by the referees in this match. Particularly the yellow card that was given in the position that Udogie tripped and the laughable offside decision. It shouldn`t have been like this. But to be fair you lads showed steely determination despite the circumstances. I hope you will keep up the great form this season (and so will we.)  Cheers,"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Liverpool should be proud, ref fucked them over completely. Spurs can’t win without these kinds of decisions, can’t wait for the fall of spurs soon. Refs should be made to come out and apologise and undo what they have done or face been charged for it."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,😢
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Been watching Spurs for 60 years and every time versus Liverpool the ref wears RED. This time he wears white and the scousers dont like it. Karma. We have a lot of catching up to do.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"How can we protest against PGMOL? The refree made the worst mistake and this is not first or second. And I don't think PGMOL will rectify this. This is big problem. VAR didn't make even a line when Diaz's goal was canceled. Jota didn't have intention to tackle, but got yellow card, which made red card. Liverpool was great, but refrees need severe penalty or criticism. PL need better refree estimation system."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,LFC robbed by human error
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,no question about the jones' red card cuz there have been similar red cards but jota's first yellow and diaz offside is questionable.

I suggest that an observer from each team be placed in the VAR room so that the VAR referees and their irresponsible and unprofessional decisions can be monitored. For example (for a match between Tottenham and Liverpool, there must be an observer from Liverpool FC present in the VAR room whose wages are paid by Liverpool FC, and a special observer from Tottenham FC present in the VAR room whose wages are paid by Tottenham FC so that each observer can ensure that the arbitration cases are reviewed correctly and in accordance with for clean arbitration rules)  I write in Arabic.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,I can see the onside of Diaz's goal all the way from The United States. What is VAR doing?😮😮😮. Jota didn't even touch no one to get the first yellow card. Obvious to the naked eye. Jones red card was not suppose to be a red card at all as the ball rolled on to his ankle and couldn't control where his foot landed. I guess Totee was playing with 18 men as the match officials are once again caught with match fixing. Apology won't do anything as teams could loose tens of millions of dollars by either not making to the top 4 of PL table to play in UCL or even win a title or be relegated because of a point difference. A total disgrace.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Officials in this game need to be questioned. Firstly that's not offside. The onnfield referee does not know the game. That not a red card his leg went over the ball not intentional foul... Jota's first yellow was was incorrectly given. These VAR officials and the referee need to be questioned. Fans deserve an explanation and the team

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Keep your head up, Joel. From Ars fan."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Apparently VAR didn't realise the lino raised his flag and goal had been disallowed. So they assumed they was just doing a routine check for what they thought was a clear goal. We have incompetent idiots controlling our gamel. 💯%
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,So proud to be a Liverpool fan. Such mixed feelings — extremely proud of the boys and devastated about gross negligence by the officials. Can’t think they are corrupt but just unprofessional and probably biased  - Offside decision. No need to speak here. Just showed it to my 9yr old daughter. She clearly sees  the white leg being closer to the goal - Curtis’ red — the leg slips above the ball and the referee is only shown a replay of the last episode where Curtis hits the guys. Should watch the whole episode. Respect Roy Keane for speaking up on this - first yellow for Mac Allister is ridiculous — other episodes like when they whistle for Salah clearly winning the ball…

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"How to win a game on behalf of a team: Red card for a maybe yellow card infraction, no foul kick for that team, another yellow card for a no foul play by Jota and then red card him when he was actually the one that was innitially been fouled. And by the way how did the VAR decide Diaz goal as a no goal? What a mess. With 10 men we could have either held our own or win but the referee is bought and paid by. Say what you want to say but this my freedom of speech. There were numerous times I was mad at some of the guys or the coaching staff but not this one. This is clear. Liverpool is been targeted this season as it looks like but we will finish at the top of the table, Insha Allah."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,I should think that Allison is the best Goalkeeper❤
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,That Diaz goal that was disallowed was actually a wrong decision. It was a human error. That goal wasn’t offside (Source:OneFootball). Though I gotta say Tottenham played really nicely yesterday and deserved their win. It hurts as a Liverpool fan that Matip scored an own goal in the last minute but let’s not blame him. He was solid throughout the game and let’s not take away anything from his performance due to that own goal.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I'm a Tottenham fan, but Diaz's first goal was onside. This is a clear mistake and Liverpool are understandably upset. But is there nothing to be said about two red cards. If you watch the video during the first sending off, he pressed his foot on Bissouma's ankle in a tackle. Moreover, during his second dismissal, while trying to make up for his mistake, he made an unreasonable tackle in a situation where no tackle was necessary, and there were many dangerous back tackles.  With 9 players completely on defense, Tottenham's attack became more difficult than when there were 10 players. I admire the fighting spirit of both teams.  Please apologize deeply to Liverpool fans for the referee's misjudgment."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"Luis Diaz goal was definitely onside but lets talk about the red card as well, Curtis Jones and Bissouma both contending for the ball, Jones got the ball at first but his leg rolled over the ball and then hit the ankle of bissouma, it wasn't deliberately done and it wasn't a serious challenge for a straight red, Furthermore I cant say that Jota clearly doesn't deserve the red but im my opinion, That's a light challenge for a send off  especially because Liverpool were 10 men already. BTW I'm a Real madrid fan"

But the 2 team who have no european football, as Liverpool and europa league is nothing to bost off.  Therfore those guys will do it very good in the premier league. I think that liverpool can guard the 2nd position vs arsenal this time. And i think that spurs can keep and still be in 4th position when season is finished."

By the way, I doubt Diaz was offside, I don't see it clearly at least:/ we have to trust the var and the referees but I was surprised they didn't spent more time on this. It would've nice to have a clear explanation with an indisputable camera angle. Also, the second red card seems a bit harsh to me. Not outrageous but still severe considering the circumstances.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,Most rigged game I’ve seen
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,I don’t know who checks on the refs in EPL but they should closely into these errors on VAR.  especially now that it’s known that Barcelona paid the refs during all the titles won with Pep… and today the Man City loses this happens.  The sport changed so now you have the tool.  It’s is not “human error” to deliberately not use it.  The first yellow on Robertson is very very questionable to say the least.  The foul by Jones that resulted in the first red card was not intentional. He slides over the ball but I won’t ague that because intensity and intent are hard to measure.  I can’t wait to see what surfaces in the next few days
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"OMG, They must take 2 players out to make the strength of the two team equal😅"

I was on the phone with my mate during the call and he was saying that maybe he has the Liverpool glasses on, but it didnt seem like a red and it didnt seem like an offside. And he is never biased in these situations, so when I saw these situations. Pathetic. Premier League needs to invest in referees, they need to pay better wages and then they can held them liable.

Once so proud and fearless in the stands, ready to face anything that comes against the club, be it Soviet Union, Aliens, an effing Predator from the movies metaphorically, we´d not stand down in fear.

Why are they the only ones who make mistakes and score goals against Liverpool? There is no benefit, no matter how much they improve, they come back and kill Liverpool with naive mistakes. Matip has no excuse for the goal. Stupid and reckless behavior on his part. There are a million ways to remove the ball. The least is that if you cannot remove it, let it pass and go to someone else to remove it."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"I have been watch the full match, and see that first yellow card for Jota was because opponent player dives, Jota did not even touch him, did I missed anything?"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liverpool,"😡😡😡Refereeing and VAR errors do not prevent the coach from making serious mistakes in choosing the starting lineup for the players today, nor do they prevent his mistakes in changing players.  He also bears some tactical and technical mistakes, including: leaving Mohamed Salah isolated from his offensive support, which made him unable to find support from his teammates while he was surrounded by two to three defenders in cases of counterattacks.  Tsoboslai has not provided the desired addition in the midfield since the beginning of the season, neither in seizing the ball, nor in creating an attack, nor in scoring, because he is a player who does not possess speed.  We still have individual mistakes by defenders that have been going on for years until this match, in addition to the absence of a right-handed defender...Losing today’s match meant that we missed an opportunity that will no longer be at the top of the standings, and therefore I see that since today we have lost the championship."

De-pressurization is at the level of a high school student, only the speed and shooting ability are good, but the basic skills are too lacking. He is said to have only learned basic tricks from his father when he was young, but he keeps getting the ball taken away. It's so inconvenient. On the contrary, Korea's Lee Kang-in is a master of depressurization and is in stark contrast. I don't understand why Son Heung-min gets such a high sick leave. When he catches the ball in a crowded area, he is always taken away and anxious. And he's so selfish that Kane can't love him. Conte is right. It is not an altruistic team.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Cuti Romero is always working his butt off, trying to cover the slacks of his teammates like, His Royal Slowness, Eric Dyer. If I, as a viewer am this frustrated, I can only imagine Cuti's frustration.   He has been criticized for this and that, but there were times when he was forced to play extra aggressively and draw a card. It was either that or letting his opponents score and win the game. Only Sonny seemed to have perceive Cuti's heart and intentions and Cuti being surprised by Sonny's perceptiveness. The man is willing to draw a card, at the risk of being tossed out or tossed out, sacrificing himself for the team and yet fans and anti-fans complain Cuti is playing too aggressively. This man was never a lamb, HE WAS AND IS A LION. Isn't this why Tottenham recruited him?  Nothing worse than when you're trying to do the best and fans misunderstand the player's intentions and blame him for things that are beyond his control. Cuti is a great player and he can play for any club. The fans should give him more respect & appreciation before this man decides to pack up and leave too. We already know Harry & Sonny will leave after this season."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"I think I've never seen a team having that much bad luck as the Spurs here. 3-0 down in the beginning, 3rd a penalty, so many post hits and missed chances, as if they were cursed, then a potential red card not given to Liverpool. Despite all that, they still were able to equalize almost at the end and by no other than Richarlison vs Alisson... but then the controversial celebration. Of course all that gets punished immediately. I'm not a fan of either teams, but that was painful to watch, I felt the Spurs fans!"

Cuti's assist to Sonny's goal and of course our boy Richie's goal, assisted by Sonny. I love this trio.   So happy for Richie that he scored, and a very dramatic one, where his goal gave us a tie at 3-3. Soooooo glad it was a Sonny assist.   WHY DID THEY DELETE THE BEST PART?   Sonny congratulating Richie with a hug and encouraging Richie to do his dance! Sonny & Pombo doing Pombo's dance!

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,Turning point for SON & KANE to leave in the summer
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Conte was limiting both Sonny and Perisic, Perisic under Conte limited Sonny's advantage on speed, off-ball movement, and his long-range because Perisic was given a position to stay up as high as a winger which really slowed the attacking pace down, which doesn't really fit how Spurs plays. But after Conte, just look at how Perisic, Sonny, and Kane (always the best) are doing. It's just so much better. The problem we have left is the midfielders and defenders. Eric Dier, anyone could tell he was horrible. Porro has advantages in attacking, but isn't the best for a full-back; he sometimes makes stupid mistakes and is too eager to score a goal as a defender. Skipp, IDK what this guy is doing not a good passer, not a good dribbler, not a good defensive midfielder, he's just running around like fool. Lastly some concerns about Kane too. He's all good but this kind of play style really limits Kane's ability to finish. We do not have good playmakers like Messi or KDB (just as an example). Even Son is more like a finisher/scorer rather than a traditional winger. This really limits Kane to sit at the half-line like Central Attacking Midfielder and give good passes to the wingers for a finish. We really need players like Eriksen (who left the club). We saw Kane and Son as a two top for a while in this  game and I can tell that it works better than three top formation. Our three top formation can't move the ball forwards to the attackers so well."

The manager wasn't the problem, the players were the problem.  There are only players who do not try to press hard, try to avoid responsibility, and are selfish.  I didn't press hard for 90 minutes, so my ball possession rate was at the bottom  A team without passion. I envy Newcastle.  If you can’t defend, die.  Don't tackle Romeroner, just stick close if you don't want to shoot  For 90 minutes, press and run for 90 minutes. Fans want that kind of passion."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,Liverpool deserved a win...Tot..deserved a draw..gd game..
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,Mason should consider dropping Dier
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"I like Dier personally but his Tottenham career seems to be over. He's afraid to raise the line. You can't hold a trophy for a defender who is too much to face an opponent's. For clubs that have to hold Kane and Sonny, it is essential to recruit defenders. It's right to give up Dier because they can't give up Kane and Sonny. In order to persuade Kane, Levy will have to choose a good manager, but Kane will be able to challenge again only when he is promised to release the recruitment funds to completely replace the current defense. This defense can never convince Kane. Tactically, there is also a limit to covering the players' weaknesses. Now they have to spend a lot of money on a proven defender. This is their last chance"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"왜 팀의 수비가 망가졌는지 아시나요? 근본적인 이유를 알려드리죠. 결론부터 말씀드리면 페리시치와 포로라는 2명의 수비력이 없는 윙백 2명때문에 벌어진 사태죠.  페리시치와 포로같은 윙백때문에 분명히 코치진들이 센터백들에게 윙백들이 수비력이 부족하니까 여유가 되는 상황에서는 그 윙백들 수비를 좀 같이 도와줘라고 말했을겁니다.   (다이어 같은 센터백들은 원래 수비실력이 않좋았던것도 있지만)  수비수들은 무엇보다 가장 합리적이고 더 나은 판단을 빨리 내리는게 중요합니다. 즉 예를들어 내가 저쪽애를 마크하러 가는게 낫겠구나 그러면 이쪽상대를 내옆 동료가 마크하는게 나을거니까 라는식의 판단을 빨리 하고 실행을 하죠. 그런데...기존의 일반적인 수비방식이 아닌....우리팀에 수비수중에 수비력이 안돼는 수비수가 2명이 생기면서 그 윙백 2명이 각자 마크해야할 상대선수까지 여차하면 도와줘야하는데...다른정상적인 팀이라면 이런일은 벌어지지 않는거죠.. 우리팀만 현재 윙백이 있는데 그 윙백은 수비력이 0에 가까우니까요. 그래서 그 윙백이 혹시 뚫리면 도와주러 가는 경우까지 생각해야하게 되죠. 그래서 판단을 하는데 있어서 더 복잡해지고 그래서 생각하는데 시간이 더 걸리기도 하고 잘못된 판단을 하게되기도 할껍니다.  또는 코치진이 그렇게 오더를 하진 않았을지라도 센터백들이 윙백들의 수비실력을 믿지 못하게 되서 결국 그런 경우까지 대비하고 고려해서 판단을 하게 됬을지도 모릅니다.  그래서 결국엔 센터백 1명이 이런일을 계속하다보니 계속 문제가 생기고 또 다른 센터백도 이 센터백을 신뢰할수가 없게 되고 또 반복되는 문제가 생기게 되죠.  또한 이 윙백들이 수비또한 잘 하지도 않기도 하고 수비실력도 없어서 윙포워드들 또한 망가지고 있죠. 윙포워드들이 이 윙백이 공격하러 자리를 비우면 그거 백업하느라 더욱 수비쪽으로 위치하게 됩니다. 그래서 공격하러 올라가는 거리가 길어지게되고 더욱 지치게 됩니다. 그래서 공격수가 공격포인트가 별로 없게 된다고 사람들로 부터 비난을 받게되고 그로인해 공격을 하러올라갔을때 평정심을 잃고 좀더 욕심을 부리게 되어 무리한 슈팅을 나사하게 되기도 합니다.   즉 이렇게 윙백을 위한 축구를 하던 콘테 하나때문에 팀전체가 무너진거죠..  이에대한 증빙자료가 될만한 사실로는 페리시치가 영입되기 전까지는 수비조직력이 괜찮아서 전시즌 후반기때는 성적도 잘나와서 탑4에 들어 챔스도 나가게됬죠. 그런데 같은 센터백선수인데...페리시치가 영입된 이번시즌 부터는 수비조직력이 30퍼센트정도 하락했죠.  실점 상황을 보면 알수있죠. 그리고 올 겨울 포로가 영입되고나서는 수비조직력이 60퍼센트까지 더 하락하게되고 실점은 더욱 늘어나게 됩니다.  즉 수비력없는 윙백(페리시치)이 1명 생겼을땐 실점이 30퍼센트 늘었고 수비력없는 윙백(포로)이 1명 더 생기니까 실점이 60퍼센트인 2배로 더 늘었죠. 양쪽다 수비력없는 윙백이 출전해버리니까 수비조직력이 완전 막장이 되어버린거죠.  윙백은 수비는 할줄 모르는데 그렇다고 공격을 공격수보다 잘하는것도 아니고...도데체 이런 비효율적인 짓을 왜 콘테는 한겁니까.  즉 콘테는 공격이 전문인 공격수들에겐 수비를 시키고, 공격이 전문이 아닌선수들에게 공격을 시켰죠. 얼마나 비효율적이냐구요.  다음시즌엔 이런 폐단을 없애려면... 페리시치와 포로 같은 윙백은 팔아버려야합니다.  4백 시스템으로 정상적수비력을 갖춘 풀백을 영입하고 좋은감독 영입해야합니다"

Spending between 5 and 12 mio โฌ for starters in Tottenham in a defensive minded team (last managers) who play against the best teams in the world - does that make sense Tottenham? Its a joke and the club needs to understand at which level these players are. 57 goals conceded with 4 games to go - relegation teams at the bottom get battered like that!"

If we can preserve all the attackers and recruit Lee Kang-in and Kim Min-jae, we can win the league next year. You'll be excited about their skills.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"We hit the bar three times, deki missed an easy one, jota got away with a clear red card, Dier trying his hardest not to defend, and we still got it up to 3-3, only for Lucas to give the game away to the player who should have been sent off. Another level of sports"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,Richy really went hard with this celebration just to concede a few seconds later... feel bad for both him and Lucas blundering such comeback in one of his last games for Spurs :/
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Self fulfilling prophecy by Conte. Mourinho et al! Tottenham can spin it any way they like but the players are mentality soft. Overall, I suspect the mentality is soft around the club as a whole - the Chairman is not faultless but he doesn't play 90 + minutes. Tottenham are not RELENTLESS. They are SPINELESS literally and metaphorically. You can't build a team with Eric Dyer as your starting center back he's NOT an Alpha! Romero would be the one to lead this team (He has not be faultless either). Dyer coasts most of the game. He hates closing down, covering or winning duals! Look at the goals Spurs concede and you will see he doesn't put his body on the line for the team (half sprinting to close  space, hates blocking or wedge tackling.)  Hates basic defending - so why have him in the most important position on the pitch? Won't hold his team mates accountable - simply NOT a leader!"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,What the blood hell is going on with Spurs' defenses?🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,This team would have crumbled with conte or stellini in charge Ryan Mason doesnt waste time talking and got the team back together in these tough moments improving their mindset He deserves credit

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Не знаю, почему все так разочарованы, но это был один из тех матчей, за которые не стыдно. Несмотря на то, что было в первом тайме, невероятно сильно, как они собрались в конце. Я не знаю, за какие заслуги карма так жестка к этому клубу, правда. Просто грустно, что за минуту до конца вот такое вот происходит. Я просто радовалась голу Ричи, как мы уже  проиграли.  Сложно видеть, как Кейн все еще старается, как Сон в конце был полностью опустошен. Они боролись - это самое главное.  Печально видеть Мейсона таким подавленым, особенно когда видишь, как он искренне переживает.  Я считаю ситуацию со Скиппом непреемлемой, это разбивает мне сердце. Светлый мальчик, надеюсь с ним все будет в порядке.  Светлая полоса когда и настанет и на нашей строне.  А пока судья клоун, я хочу поддержать парней!  COYS! 🤍"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"If there's anything we clearly learned this season is that our offense is not the issue, it is the defense. 😔 Hope Levy understands this."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"I still can't forget the moment when Dier yelled at Sonny for 'better defense'. He has lost 57 goals in the league, twice as many and 3 more than Newcastle (27). Does he deserve to yell at someone to be good at something? He has worse judgment than the academy's defenders, and less determined than a seventh-division player who works as a carpenter on weekdays and participates in weekend games. Today he was, as expected, a disaster. One good thing for Levy was that today he didn't have to refund for fans for the tickets. COYS!!🤣😂"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,🤭
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"How did Jota not get a red??!! Whats with these referee decisions against Tottenham. Man United was saved from a red and now Liverpool. If Mason can just get a decent CB to pair with Romero then we should have some chance. He prefers a 4-2-3-1. Play Son, Kulu, Kane, and Richie as 4 top."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Positives Kane, Sonny, Richy. Richy finally scoring. The comeback LEVYOUT chants on the 22 minute Passion  Negatives: The defence Foster, 4 shots on goal, all in the net.  Moura gifting away more points.  The fact some fans still don't blame the board."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Gakpo not passing the ball to Elliot, Salah or Trent to shoot for the fourth goal gave Tottenham a lifeline back into the game. Selfishness when you're goals up will cost you just like Dembele's cost Barca against Liverpool. Continue the same thing that got you the first, second and third goal, which is: passing to the player who is more likely to score and in a better position to shoot."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,Oh well at least we now score goals too
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Fue un buen partido remontamos casi al final pero nuestra defensa no fue lo suficientemente buena para congelar el resultado, jugamos bien pero ellos lo hicieron mejor."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,shit
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"i don't think i've ever felt this way after any other match before. forget that southampton 3-3. forget all the losses in the cup competitions to small teams. forget the chamions league final. i don't know what it is, but this match left me completely emotionally destroyed. i don't know what to feel. i know this match doesn't hold much significance as we might not even make top 4 anyway. plus, i've already given up on this season. but for some reason, this is the most deflated i've ever been supporting tottenham. it was instant dissappointment after conceding three. then it was worrying about this game becoming another newcastle. then the building hope as we scored each goal. then it was the dreaming of a historic comeback at anfield. then it was absolute euphoria as richy scored. and just as i was still celebrating like mad, it was complete devastation. i literally felt the highest form of happiness and lowest form of sadness within a fcking minute. i feel like i've just let all my fcking emotions out and now i'm just empty. but in a very negative way. why lucas why"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham,"Spurs have conceeded 3 goals in less than 20 mins, then equalized in the 93rd minute to get 1 point and then lost all 3 points in less than a minute! Only Spurs can do stuff like this!"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"Here is a very unlikely scenario granted,  but hey just for fun here we go...  Liverpool win all their remaining games. Man Utd do not gain more than 8 points from their 6 remaining games. Man Utd results - lose away to both Brighton and West Ham. Win at home against Wolves and Fulham. Draw away to Bournemouth and draw at home to Chelsea. Thus Liverpool and Man Utd finish both on 71 pts but realistically Liverpool will have a superior goal difference so will clinch the 4th spot. ..This scenario is of course discounting  Brighton going on a mad run (which considering their form could indeed happen) and Newcastle imploding in their fixtures. Anyway, lots of daft and very unlikely permutations but stranger things have happened and all that!"

A Klopp-Moment forever, for his highlight video. His passion, red, his will, so strong, unwavering the start, the sprint to the fourth referee, so fast, the hamstring, not warmed up, injured, but a winner. In one minute only the emotions going down preparing to bear frustration, then up to 1000% dopamine. In the body of Jurgen Klopp this means aging 2 years just like that. You Never Win Alone! 💪🏼"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,We need to resolve our defensive issues. Top teams do not let go of a 3 goal lead after 20 mins. We are conceding too many goals just like our first season with klopp winning games 5-4 etc. We have gone backward 5 years this season. Unacceptable

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,This match 💥
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,I wonder what went wrong in Spurs' defence at Liverpool's final goal. Lucas quickly blames Romero - perhaps Romero called the pass unaware of Jota making the run in case of a mistake? I feel sorry for Lucas nonetheless - 15 minutes in the last two games with a fatal mistake and a red card for the resume. Great game - had all my staff at work holding their breath for the last few minutes!

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"I have been away from sports and football for many years now. I use to watch them on television in the years 1998- to 2007, but it was not a lot. I use to keep up with the exploits of Ronaldo and Messi but never had time to watch full matches. Recently after the world cup I started watching on Youtube and found myself connecting with Brighton and Hove Albion and becoming their fans, but in the last couple of weeks I find myself increasingly watching more matches. As it was sunday I watched both Man C and Man U matches on my two computer screens simultaneously,While I enjoy Man C's play I do like all the other teams even the lower ones as all of them fight to survive. The relegation format and the English Premire legue is really one of the best in the world. As I wanted to know who will take the No. 5 spot I did watch the entire Liverpool vs Tottenham match as a 3rd party and boy if every there was a match that brings a past fanatic back to being one. The last minute of the game reminded me why I was the lone kid in my school in India watching English football matches while all the rest watched cricket or something else. Now I pretty much will end up watching almost all matches if I can or at least extended highlights. The ""bug"" was hovering over me, bet me and now has laid eggs in my brain."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"Klopp have tried to changed so many 11 squad. How about use Gomez(or the other player) as right back then use Trent as midfield on the right side as 4-3-3 or whatever formation. Klopp never tried this one. I bet it will has better result. Trent has far better and have more energy than Hendo or Elliott, Both attacking and Defending. Hendo is too old now to do anything, Elliot still have to learn a lot for his positioning especially for defending, he always lack in that. So many times Liverpool lost the goal on the gap between Trent(Right wing)& Centre back.  This game as well, first and second goals also on that gap. All midfielder didnโt press the ball good for the whole season.(That one point got to be improve) So use the other right wing then put trent on the Midfield. Trent press will improve defending level for the team for sure."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"I pulled it back last match but I wanna say it this time. West Ham`s goal was on Van-Dijk, while Matip was the man of the match. Yet, Mr Klopp benched Matip and let Van-Dijk. I believe there is a hidden rule in life: you should be honest and fair to be rewarded with great results. This is one reason why someone like Pep is consistent on top; he would bench Cancelo for some academy player if he felt that the latter is working and providing more.    We were about to get punished today, also with van-Dijk`s mistakes, and I believe the first thing that Mr. Klopp should look at when he revises what went wrong this season, is his judgment approach."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"Klopp is a world class manager and I love him so don't get me wrong, Klopps weakness is his loyalty to players. Just because a player has been good for the team doesn't mean he should play now and he's out of form another thing is he doesn't use the players who are in form - why not start Jota, clearly he's in form and Klopp should make the most of that especially since we chasing top 4.   The difference between Klopp And Pep is Pep uses players who are in form and working hard and benches players who have dropped below his standards, no matter who you are. Klopp should lose his loyalty to players and get rid of these players who are here and not doing anything.  Good game though 😂"

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,Of course these highlights don't include the Jota foul. Wouldn't want people calling the win into question with a balanced set of highlights...

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"First time in a long time , Liverpool is not in the top 4 teams in PL.  For the 2021 and 2022 seasons, Liverpool has been mediocre in its consistency.  Lots of world class top players in its line up , but their consistency has sucked big time. Losing to low level teams , and even Newcastle is performing much better than Liverpool.  If Liverpool wants to be a top contender next season , it will really need to do a complete rebuild and shakedown of the team , to “find themselves” again.  They are a far cry from the winning and championship capable team from the 2018/2019.      Man city is performing at such a proficient level , that nothing will be able to touch them as contenders, for the next couple of seasons.   In the past seasons , PL teams would be apprehensive about taking on liverpool , because of the superb consistency and also how well the team as a whole was clicking together so well like a super well oiled machine.  Now , they have no qualms or doubts about taking on the current Liverpool team."

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,When they scored the 3rd I was panicking but Jota simply put it into the back of the net
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,why liverpool why
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,Why didn't Klopp start Jota after the last good few performances? I swear the guy has to do double the effort to get some recognition. He'll many of the other forwards under Klopp would still be giving chances when they weren't scoring (and Jota had an excuse as he had a big injury).  I don't like Klopp still plays favourites. Not very fair.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"Before 20 mins, I recognized that I was worried about Hotspurs. They were different team who we met before. It was available to make a crital chance with only two or three touch even though they keep their defensive position and go down. I thought 'Too pitiful...'  but after that time, our defence gave me a lesson, that I heared from the Bible;  “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?""  yes. we won. It was a fun game and I think adrenallin is still running in my blood vessel. it seems something to improve is left but I'm trying to enjoy the result. Thanks for the goo... fun game."

I will add if Jota's was a red on Skipp  then so was his challenge on Diaz, both won the ball. And anyone who thinks that moron Richarlison was a penalty  I don't know what you're watching. Yes, Konate has his arms on him  but it was BLATANTLY obvious the guy literally fell backwards to the floor  deliberately, it was embarrassing. Can't stand that mug!  nothing against Spurs fans I just can't stand Richarlison!"
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"Have some relaxation today on the part of the team Is the reason for Liverpool's failures in all tournaments this season the relaxation and recklessness on the part of the team?

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,Tierney should be banned from any Liverpool game. What a joke.
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,Can we put an official complaint against Paul Tierney? He shouldn't be allowed to officiate our games.

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,"with taa playing more in midfield we really can’t depend on vvd and ibou to cover for him defensively, we all have seen what vvd did today… taa side is wide open we desperately need someone else to fill that space so how about playing either matip or gomez as a rb while taa can play as a rwb or rm."
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,My club 🔥
Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,man that was close definitely need to sell vvd and konate our defence needs upgrading in the summer

Youtube,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Liverpool,I can never understand how Nunez plays with a great team like LFC. He is useless in both ends. He broke the off-side line in Tott equalizer. It's unexplainable at all. No  good team will bid for him if he offers transfer.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves May 14,Wolves,As a man u fan I appreciate the performance of your goalkeeper
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves May 14,Wolves,"To be honest I’m fairly unbothered, of course I’d love a big result, but we saw Daniel Bentley have a masterclass (8 saves, 3 dive saves and 4 in the box + a high claim), and to be fair we have little to play for, our focus should be on transfers which it is at the moment which is encouraging. We’ll bounce back against Everton"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves May 14,Manchester United,still think Bruno would be better employed as the partner to Casemiro in the box to box further back position with sancho as the number 10 garnacho left antony right with rashford or martial as striker with the defence pushed further up closing the space down and pinning the opponents into their half but i know that's just me.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves May 14,Manchester United,"That first miss should have been a goal. With the ability that Antony has, he should aim to be the player with the most assist every season. He should follow and learn from the likes of Giggs, Best and Beckham."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves May 14,Manchester United,"The truth is, our team's right flank was more aggressive with Antony on the pitch than without him on the pitch. He is learning and improving... if it was the old him, he will just shoot the ball instead of attracting the defenders to him and pass the ball to Martial to score. He is aggressive and improving... he has an attitude, that's what I want with my attackers, and somehow I think he only listens to Ten Hag. 😅 As for Garnarcho, STARBOY... he is not just talented, he has something special in him... fearless... I think Antony, Garnacho both have a great future ahead. Can't wait to see Amad compete with Antony for the right-wing position as well."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves May 14,Manchester United,"It's hard to believe Sancho is going to wake up after many seasons. United just need to accept that he's not that type of PL player needed here. Martial is too old, both in and out, perhaps Seria A is his next destination.

And watching how things have been going in the last 10 years (and even more since 16/17) is egregious. This was another game that raises red flags for the season that just started. This video isn't honest about what happened in the game, the 5/6 clear chances wolverhampton had and the penalty at the end of the game which could cost 2 points. I honestly don't understand, I think this is going to be another hard season, but I do hope I'm completely wrong."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Horrible performance so disappointed
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Poor start in all honestly, hardly any big chances, Bruno just hitting and hoping as always, Garnacho being greedy and we need a proper number 9.. And dont mention that discount Haaland who we signed. We need a world class striker"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,МЮ красава!!!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Id like to see the highlights from a Wolves perspective.. they ran though United’s midfield all night.. probably deserved at least a draw if not a win.  A lot to learn from that game.. United can and have to do better.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,The performance in this match was horrendous.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"I wonder why is hard for people to see that the number 7 shouldn't have been given to mount. Any player that takes that number will surely flop. If mount wants to succeed at old trafford, he should drop that number 7."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Antony still making bad decisions on attacking transitions. both times he should have passed out wide to Garnacho where they was alot of space and an overload with Mount for an easy goal. he needs to get serious else his position in the starting Xi becomes untenable  oh and yes, forget using a midfield of Bruno, Mount & Casemiro starting together.......it lacks serious defensive support & Wolves exploited it to the fullest."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolves should’ve won lmaooo

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Looking at the bright side, even though it was a terrible performance, compared to the start of last season it went very well.  I'd rather have a slow start and then get more comfortable than starting with a bang and fizzle out"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,A ground out win when not at our best; I'll take the win; none of the silly negativity...
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Rashford really can’t play central striker.  Our midfield just can’t control the game. We need a midfielder that is calm and can dictate the middle of the park, in the mould of Carrick type of player. But we bought Mason Mount, a headless chicken. Basically another Jesse Lingard."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Look at Sancho at 1:44. This kid is stealing a living
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"maybe Man Utd can borrow joao felix for a while as a striker, while waiting for Rasmus Højlund to recover. There is still a delay in the transfer."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Even this year top 4 finish
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,It's regrettable that Onana himself refuses to acknowledge the fact that he committed the foul.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana surely was fortunate at the end. The way he pounced reminded me of my nephew who jumps on me the same way if he spots me in the crowd. 😂 But what a game. Thrilling to the end. Glad we won❤

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolves were lucky to come away with a loss. They hardly created a chance.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Wan Bissaka was the only player on that pitch that was solid, partially Varane as well. The rest, what can I say. Was like a casual Sunday league game to them. Can see Ten Haag hasn't changed his tactics from last season. Let's hope he changes things. First game though and a win is a win, lets see next round."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,if wolves can do this too man utd then what will better teams do
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,garnacho too much complaining
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Few points i think man united fans agree:  1. Rashford is not a striker and should play as left winger, even when the main striker is unavailable  2. Maguire should get out. So, we can get some money to sign other players. If he insists on staying, he should be excluded from the team.  3. We can clearly see that we should've signed De Jong or caicedo. Fernandes and Mount can't start together in these certain tactics. Amrabat is the most crucial signing.   4. We need a world-class striker. Period. someone who can raise the team when it is down. Period. I guess you all saw how many easy opportunities we missed and how messed up the system becomes when rashford leaves the wing to play as a striker.  5. This team needs motivation, I don't WHY but I see other teams playing with more passion and stamina.  This team needs: Osimen, Pavard, Amrabat, and full-backs.  And then you can think about competing city and arsenal"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,MU in trouble.  Not a championship team.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Pre season tour has exhausted our players instead of revitalising them. Casemiro looked leggy, martinez nowhere near his best. Garnacho looked jaded, Rashford running into people as per usual. Sancho was the only glimmer of positivity we had. Lucky to get those three points. Eric do your thing please! Wake these boys up!"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,By this game i can see that rasmus hojlund wont be of much help our attack is toothless and terrible  The mid is the bases of any football match and mount is terrible need amrabat asap
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,MU need to improve urgently

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Pathetic attacking display. Rashford has forgotten to play as a centre forward. Højlund is needed immediately and I hope he will be clinical. Rashford should start on the left which means Garnacho will get limited time. Antony is still lacking any end product. Sancho, Garnacho, Antony needs to understand that they must create chances or score themselves. We need an end product, flashy tricks or dribbling comes later."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,United  needs two strikes Rusford is not striking the goal at all
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Awful display, need to improve massively"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Highly overrated team united
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,First game jitters and all that. ETH no doubt will be having stiff words with the team he’s a tactician specialist . Let’s see our display next game.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"The midfield was inexistent the most Bruno and Mount and Case has not a great pace and need to carry the all midfield and also didn't had a great game neither we need a more solid CDM/CM like Amrabat,Onana or other....and also of course a CB from Pavard or Todibo instead of slabhead and maybe we can sell Martial and buy another young striker and Garnacho has clear much better impact off the bench and not as a starter and also Rashy is wasted at ST as we should play Rashford LW and Sancho at false 9 until Hojlund is back"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Ggmu. Best of luck!  ❤

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Antony needs to be more mature with his decision making.

Forward players were terrible as well. Garnacho had a shocker. Antony started from where he left. He is pure average. Still trying to understand how we paid 90 m for him.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"And onana, that was a penalty, bruh. Bcs it's old trafford wolves didn't get one"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"fidget spinner antony and mount were absolutely rubbish. i'll spare garnacho because of his age and experience. we still need a midfielder and a defender, and the glazers continue to stall."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,It was a clear loss....better loose n bounce back rather than win undeserved matches
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We need number9 who can score 20 above
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Rashford CANNOT be the main striker for United. he's not clinical enough
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,1. Onana is going to have a great season.  2. Luke Shaw was better as a proper wing back 3. Antony still atrocious 4. Garnacho needs to get his head up and make the right passes at the right time.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Robbery
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Dreadful performance, worst game I've seen from Casemiro, looked like he was running in mud. Mount was dreadful, really poor movement off the ball and poor when he had the ball but that was the case for most of the team. Can't understand why someone with more presence hasn't been  signed in the midfield. We didnt need Mount."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,A very shameful match... Anthony is wack
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,This reminds me of Fergie days.We usually started the season like this
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I see varane enjoying playing with onana
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We're just starting
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,The defensive midfield department of Manchester United is very weak. Casemiro CANNOT do the job on his own. He needs help. Does the Director of Football not see this? Why the delay in bringing in Amrabat and other defensive midfield reinforcements?
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,keren
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolves going down
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Get us mid fielders, mount and Bruno can't work playing that high. One has to drop deep. Don't use single pivot Casemiro is aging and energy dropping"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Mainoo injury is a big blow to the team. What is the use of having midfielders with no ball retention? It’s chaos. Amrabat is needed like yesterday 😢
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,If we play like this against Tottenham Hotspur we will be in serious serious trouble.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Why didn't Machester United buy Kylian Mbappe? Look at this offense. Again struggle to finish top 4? For how many years?

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"the amount of times, antony cudda passed to garnacho. this is so bad........."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Manchester united not ready for this season
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,nothing to be happy about
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Antony would have drifted to his left here 0:18 😢   Poor display from Manchester United, but next game will be better.  We need Amrabat, Garnacho shouldn't be starting, We need Kobe Maino to replace Casemiro, Greenwood needs to replace Antony, Højlund is a necessity upfront, Mount must find himself.  GGMU"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Sancho bird watching, he is finished"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Watched the first 30 minutes and switched it off! Mount is absolutely shocking. Ok hes had one game but ill say it again he aint Uniteds number 7. Onana is a bombscare waiting to happen and if he doesnt sort it out hes gonna cost united alot of points. Garnacho had a terrible game as well. Its really quite concerning.

Varane has more passion and motivation than Bruno and is more a natural leader. Sancho looks improved. Positives. Can’t wait to see Hojlund and we need Ambrabat, our midfield was weak. Wolves played well and deserved a point tbh. Lots of work still required for this United team to challenge the likes of City and Arsenal."

P.S. Man United is in desperate need of two central midfielders. 60+ games and no midfield squad is a real concern. Sign CMs ASAP."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wow! This Man Utd channel conveniently left out the most talked about incident in the whole match. The last minute VAR denied penalty. So even the club thinks it is a penalty!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"We want to sign a Central midfielder, mount is not a player we needed"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"I’m predicting that we finish 4th this season , considering city getting even better , Arsenal competing for top spot , Chelsea seeming promising and Newcastle and Liverpool as well"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana the best gk

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Menang...tapi permainan berantakan
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana 👍👍
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,If we play like this we'll finish outside top six this season
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,❤❤❤😂🎉🎉🎉MAN UNITED IS A BIG TEAM PREMIER LEAGUE COMMON LOVERS
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,You've forgotten to show us the potential last minute penalty
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Awful performance defense wise But We WILL take the W.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"we were saved by their sloppy shots on goal, need to defend better"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"disgracefull display Utd, going no were again, please tell the manager RASHFORD IS NO STRIKER"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Well played wolves!!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,needed ronaldo
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,AWB really put in the hard work today alongside Onana. He was exceptional but can't say that for the rest of the team....Less go for Spurs
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Pathetic performance. ETH must address this asap. Onana is very lucky to have escaped that penalty
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,MAGUIRE AND MCTOMINAY SHOULD BE NOT HERE. TAKE THE WEST HAM OFFER. WE NEED AMRABAT ALONGSIDE CASEMIRO AND WE SAW THAT TODAY. GLAZERS OUT🔰
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Varane❤
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"An Opening Day win, Bravo Manchester United, is the best, Man untd vs Wolves, 1 - 0"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Still that weak defending again. You can’t hope winning EPL and winning against City with this kind of performance.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Champagne not for MU this season
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Ой, как чувствую и в этом году я потрачу ещё куча нервов ….."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,sorry but RASH is not a No9 - he looked lost out there
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,When Raphael Varane goes out of the defense know that there is something going to happen
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Please can Anthony practice crosses with his Right foot, It would be really effective if he can have that option. If he played on the left and was told to just run down the wing and cross he would get lots and lots of assists & United get lots of goals, but he's told/decides to play on the right & because he cannot turn onto his right and play the cross with his right were missing that Beckham style of crosser.  When i was a School kid i was rubbish with my left but i practiced passing and shooting with my left and after awhile i did get better where i felt confident of using my weaker foot, Me and my Friends would all try to copy the latest Roberto Carlos & David Beckham free kicks. I'm not a pro, Anthony is a pro & so why isn't he told to Practice with his weaker foot for 15 mins each day?"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Кто заслужил тот и забил и отдал передачу
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Rashford out
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Hopefully we have our clinical finisher in Hojlund, because we cannot rely on Varane to score for us every game ✌🏻"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolves were better
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Sancho should have started not a sub just saying.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We made it first 3 point beginning of the session thanks MAN U team go stronger 💪
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Congratulations boys
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Bad day at the office. Shaw and Onana came in clutch.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Mount=Rubbish  He took Bruno's place so that Bruno can't play comfortably  Why did we buy this man
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I'm not thanking Onana for making saves like De Gea did to save the match (Cause i never thanked De Gea either)
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Still a shambolic performance. No improvement from last season and the seasons before it ever.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Not gonna show that clear penalty that Onana should have conceded eh?
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Lindelof is a problem
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Manchester United Performance was not satisfied me, we need to get Midfielder Can Create a lot opportunities   GGMU ❤"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Shameless club. Running scared, didn’t even show the fraudulent penalty decision that went in their favour."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,U Rob them
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana had a great debut
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Better start than last season at least 😂
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"New season, same problem"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Spend on Mount and Hojlund but wolves (not city or arsenal) dribble through the mid of the pitch everytime they want straight to Onana and no one can do anything. Like there is no one there and its the 1st match of the season 😅😅
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Debut Onana luar biasa
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"They looked outrageously off the pace, all really slow lethargic, strange"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,City has scrapped wins so many times but no 1 said a word
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Varane is fit and onana is getting there little by little
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Oh what a poor team
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,What ridiculous standards of play 🤣 this is what happens when you sell DDG!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onani very amazing
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I really miss Mason Greenwood. I eagerly anticipate his return
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,This was terrible
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Pls throw away this Burno I really hate him such a selfish player n no respect to his own player no team spirit
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,onana keep it up
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,awful performance
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Atrocious performance. Don't look fit or sharp. Midfield looks completely unbalanced. Need another CDM and our strikers need to get involved asap. Rashford is not a 9
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Lovely goal though.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,No creativity at all😢 horrible performance.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Very lucky wkwk
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Menang keberuntungan klo masalah serang kalah mu
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We were extremely poor the midfield looked not to have a clue we should have lost that game by 3 goals for sure
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Using our left wing back as an advantage was clever wolves won the ball high and used shaws flank since he overlaps
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Rashod ego
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,What aaaaa pass from Bruno 🔥🔥🔥
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"As usual, 1-0."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Ten Hag shame
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana was on fire
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I'm confident that Manu will win the title this year!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Awful football.....hopefully Mount will show up soon. Garnacho tried too hard and lost the ball too many times. Our midfield was breached too many times- the Amrabat deal needs to be completed! And yeah...that was a penalty!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,That's not a very promising game for us to go through the entire season
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Don’t know what to say about this performance.. it’s like we never improve from last season.. Rashford can’t play central. I rather have sancho as False 9 and put Rashford on the left
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Harry helped his team winning the match. Pure legend
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolves is great....
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,rubbish gameplay

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Garnacho needs to learn to always opt for options. Not charge with every ball on his feet
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I see this team fighting for Conference League for the rest of the season 😅
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,waduh..MU lawan wolves aja msh aga kewalahan nih' gmn lawan tim besar..Ten hag mesti pnya cara bermain yg lebih bagus lagi..ayo MU Jadi kan trophy liga inggris tahun ini jd milik mu
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Mount 😂
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,ONANA only use his feet to saves the opening match!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I don't see how mount will work.. Erikson came on and change the game. Bruno 8 and play mount 10.. mount not a ball carrier  .
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,3 points is all we need
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"It will be a long season ahead, when matches get closer it will test eth , lets see."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We need more defenders than strikers. Our defenders made the assist and scored!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Next mu totenham
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Why don't show the cheating VAR movement  😂🤣
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Wrong Pass Antony 0:19, should pass to far left."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,❤❤❤❤❤❤
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana ❤❤
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,In the end we need 2 defenders to score for us from attacking position. Mount was no where to be seen from the whole clips.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,С такой игрой кубок уефа нам ток светит
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolves Robbed
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,They did not show the clear penalty denied to wolves😂

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,So you didn’t feel like showing the penalty?? Kinda sums it up.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Next need more goal and defender must be stronger show the striker give more goale, go...gooo... MU... 💪"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wolverhampton dominate united
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Is this united Manchester or Manchester united 🤔🤔🤔
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,This match who actually watched not the current clip would know that we clearly need  amrabat to support casemiro..lack of energy throughout the game..
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Fluke win
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Garnacho not grown up to the task, hope Sancho starts next game he has the momentum"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Play like this against Tottenham on Saturday and we will be thrashed.Worrying times ahead.United need more signings and so far Mason Mount is a bad signing.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,What a performance by the referee and VAR 🔥🤑

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Ain't no win. Just a robbery by bullshit officiating.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Poor back line🙄🙄
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I've said it since last season.. Rashy needs to be aware of his surroundings and not just charge at goal to shoot. He needs to add this in his game. If he did add awareness he could have easily given assist to Bruno and Garnacho and be 2 goals up.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,GGMU
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Heads up lads. United under Ten Hag usually starts the season slow. I'll take the 3 points.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Same ole, same ole, not much has changed. United will finish the season lower down the pecking order as they continue to play boring football. Wolves didn't deserve to lose, they were the much better team today."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Man United must improve wolvevwere getting all chance yesterday man United were not in their form it looks like they have been locked some positions plz wake up next is Tottenham

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Sorry I know this is highlights but UTD looked disorganised, loose, and lacked ideas and drive to win. 1:0 was very lucky, Wolves played extremely well"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,So onana iis winning the golden gloves.....AGAIN.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Coys 😊
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,MVP REFIRRE
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Rashford as a No. 9 also does not work. Garnacho is better coming off the bench… Sancho start, and Antony should just not play"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Manchester always blue no red
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,VARchester Utd.  Corrupt league.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Absolutely horrible football
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Worst version of Man Utd ever since 2007-2024
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Need Amrabat alongside Casemiro to add strength to that midfield… otherwise teams would just run through them easily. It was obvious from the start. Casemiro by himself does not work
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I was expecting more than 3 goals we could have won... 😊
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We will get it right next week
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onanaaa ❤😊
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Poor midfield
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,What you guys have done yesterday was not acceptable with this badge in your chest. Despite the goal from Rolls-Royce Varane we were pathetic. We believe in you ETH. MOUNT take your time bro.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,dreadful performance to start with but we would take the win🌚
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Bruno bruno came from sporting like Cristiano he's our portugese magnifico ooooooh

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Garnacho had a poor game
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,The perfomance from unite i dont think they can compit for the league
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Finally onana can feel how de gea worked hardly
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"We will never ever again see Man Utd strong at home, only if someone similar to Sir Alex Ferguson will be the manager of this club. Why you have to shake until the end at home winning poorly 1-0? Those guys don't deserve a penny honestly. Come and work with me in construction a week and show you how to earn money for real, you f**&&-g pus-*{s"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"I don’t know, I might just be too demanding  but United still got  a pile of homework to do in the technical department, the only positive so far  is Onana’s movements and territorial prominence in the box area, that's one huge leap  into the right direction."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana🔥
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Very poor Man utd
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,ONANA one of best investment so far
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana real lucky VAR decided to take the day off at OT. Should have been 1-1 at least
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,In the first  scoring chance of wolves  I was like where is david degea😫 I forget onana
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Dissapointed win, so poor"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Worst performance of the season
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,We got lucky today.We can't win any trophy like this at all.Rashford is too selfish.We need sofyan at any cost .
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Not to be that guy but £60M for Mount is like spending £10 for a burnt slice of Pizza
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Enough with Antony, bring back my boy Greenwood"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Ugly win
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,I missed Rasmus Höjlund?

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Please stop putting the score in the title. I purposely avoided listening to or watching anything that might say it 😭.   And it's strange not seeing De Gea in goal.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Ready Liverpool 7 - 0 Manchester United
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Permainan buruk sepanjang babak 1 dan mulai membaik diparuh kedua😅semakin tdk yakin utk menjadi juara RPL😢
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"i dont think we deserve this win cause wolves plays better :') ... high expectation for next match! And perhaps hojlund can change the situation here, cause garnacho shud stay on the bench as super sub"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana ... what a player!!!

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Wow. We score one goal in opening game at home to very low level team.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"MU mainnya ancur ancuran. Kalau masih begini terus, selesai itu MU"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,It is just me or  Man United always struggles when facing Wolves? ☹️🤔
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"We'll lose badly if we play like this vs Spurs. Amazing how many times we opened up and allowed Cunha to run down the center. They would've scored at least 4 if they knew how to finish. They played as if they had a full preseason with Gary and we played as if ETH only had 1 training session with the team. We need to fix it now. If this was Liverpool it would've been a new epl record for number of goals scored. Team also seems so soft, getting pushed around and off the ball so easily. Obvious the team needs to work on their strength training as well..... So much wrong today. We got bullied in our own backyard..."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Great : AWB, Onana, Shaw Horrible : Casemiro, Garnacho, Mount  And others were below average. MU was owned by Cunha alone... and nobody in United could dribble or pass like Cunha. Lucky win that Wolves had bad shooting skills. But we got 3 points so lets improve. Great job."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,2 weeks ago many utd fans were making big claims when they beat Arsenal in a friendly. Today they were hanging on at home to a team Arsenal slapped 5-0 the last time they played. Utd will never become the team they once were under Ferguson.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,goalkeeper Onana 👍
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Faith in ETH is fading fast.  United way too slow in the build up play and too predictable . Not happy with Bruno as captain either. A top team could have been 4 or 5 against us last night . Reality check needed .
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Какая невнятная игра манчестера, можно сказать плохая игра"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Won't moan much about how terrible the performance was...  My observation is predicated on the fact that we've seen how important it is to collect max points even on days when the game is awful....  Under Ole we played seemingly great football, but we'd fail to finish games off and end up drawing unnecessarily...."

At last got all the three points."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"Saya suka melihat gaya permainan MU yg agresif, cuman setiap berhasil menguasai bola, kesalahan yg sama terus mereka lakukan seperti salah umpan terus menerus..terutama rashford yang bermain angin anginan"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Horrendous match if we play like this we cant even dream about top 4 Rashford was invisible because we play him on the left and Onana only works on counters his passing shines then so have rashy around the halfway line  because if we dont use this counter possibility then Onana will be wasted
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Sancho should start he is inform player
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,Onana is already proving to be our best signing of the window. De gea would of let a few of those shots in today.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Manchester United,"We played badly today considering our opponent has just changed their manager and a number of first team players were missing. We were playing with our best 11 and nearly concede 3-4 goals. The problem is the same as last season, we only relying on Rashford to score the goals for us but today he’s been shut quiet by opposition. Everyone played bad except for Onana, Varane and AWB.

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,thanks for the extended highlights! from a united fan. united so bad and got lucky
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Cunha needs to work on finishing. He is good enough to take Wolves into the top 6 this season. If he doesn't, he'll be another Adama Traore.  I'm a Utd fan. I heard about the Semeido handball. His hands were glued to his body.   As for the Onana incident, I feel it was dangerous and may have deserved a penalty. I think they got it all mixed up because the collision was with a player who didn't make contact with the ball. [I DON'T KNOW ALL THE WOLVES PLAYERS]  It's still dangerous play by Onana. And bad officiating by the ref for not even reviewing VAR footage for himself."

Selfishness, Rashford had a chance to pass to Garnach to score but squandered it. Same with Bruno eho wanted to score instead of a simple pass and ball was taken from his feet. This left much pressure on Midfied and defenders.  Utd must wake up or even 1st 4 will not be attained this season."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Wolves are no pushovers and so it proved, I'm not surprised we got the rub of the green, Wolves outfought us as we have no 2nd holding midfielder, we can't play 4-3-3, we need a 4-2-3-1, Mount is a great CAM but never a CDM. Credit to Wolves whom I'm sure will not only stay up but possibly finish higher than most of us expect. Their midfield is clearly better than ours!"

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"But how did wolves lose they were absolutely amazing, but that's a good sign for this season. Keep it up👏👏👍💯%"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"I'm a Manchester United supporter and have to admit wolves did well, we didn't deserve that win. Well played, our goalie really saved us"
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Manchester united left back channel is a weak point like Shaw is always running back towards his goal, although some people might claim that his offering something going forward but the end product doesn't always justify that, it would have been a disaster if had played at right back."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"As a neutral I enjoyed this game, I do think you guys should have won. You were the better team."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,U guys deserved atleast a poiny...whata a perfomanve!!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,A man United player could literally strangle someone and the referee wouldn’t go to VAR
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,That was a penalty. The referee should be shown a yellow card!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Am a Gunner and wolves is my second team. Dont worry lads, you played well, keep your heads up and your merit will soon reflect."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,The ffp rules and the var helped who called themselves the “big6” only.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Wolves were robbed by United that’s definitely a penalty
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Unlucky Wolves
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Var must be investigated, you cannot tell me there isn't corruption in the game."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Everyone wrote wolves off and they responded but they miss way too many chances and if they are not underdogs like today they won't find that much space to do these blistering counters. I'm worried for them even thou they were clearly better against an awful United side.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Wolves fans, hear me out...I watched the cross about 30 times...at normal speed and at 0.5. I think Onana was looking at the ball and when the Wolves player collided with his teammate, he stayed in that place unexpectedly for Onana. I'm not saying it's never a penalty. It could've been a penalty. But it wasn't intentional, I think. Because, after the player heads it, why would Onana just foul him AFTER he heads the ball? What reason would he have to do that? He's not defending the ball. He's not preventing the player from heading the ball. It would be insane to assume that he just went for the player with his hands like that. You try to run, reach for the ball, collide with a player, even if it's your teammate, and not let your hand go forward like his did. Try it. You don't need an actual ball. Just run, jump, reach out and bump into someone...see where your hands go. Again, if the ref had called a penalty, I would've just thought it was unfortunate, but legitimate.   Onana was a little late...and that doesn't completely justify him, but it's a world of difference between being a little late and going for a player with intent. Just like Wan Bissaka was late with that tackle. That could've easily been a yellow card...but I understand why it wasn't. When you misjudge a situation, you're late and it results with tackling a player, it's not your fault, but it still happened....so yeah, it could've been a penalty, but I understand why it wasn't.   I'm not gonna listen to what pundits have to say, cause they're disgustingly partial and all wolves fans will say it was a penalty and all utd fans will say it wasn't. If you judge an situation only through the prism of your own interest....well, you're a bit of a bastard."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Great performance by wolves they deserved all 3 points
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Man United deserved the lost today
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,I dont know how we did not we did not win that pen. But Oustanding Performance Even Though We Lost Matheus Chuna Drives With The Ball Through The Middle But Sad We Lost. Sa's Positioning wasnt right But I Think We Can See Some Big Things From Wolves!
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Not a wolves fan but that was a robbery clear penalty.😮
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,I would really say that football  demands abit of luck sometimes. Man u got the luck because i dont understand how Wolves didn't win by 4 goals to nil. There was absolutely no midfield and the foxes have to blame it on their finishing and of course Onana who was brilliant.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Wolves  should have been given penalty. Another controversy
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,How is that not a penalty in last min of the game is out of this world....referee n linemen both r blind or what...n the worst is VAR how can the person in charge not see that again n again with replay. What is the FK is gg on. In the Spurs game the VAR pull the game back after 2 min to alert the referee on a soft penalty committed by Sonny but here they do nothing. I guess is because MU is a big club playing at home so the referee do not want to spoil the fun for the home fans.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,you guys deserved that three points. gutted. unlucky.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"I'm a Spurs fan but was so impressed with what I saw last night from Wolves i just had to comment on here. The quick skillful turns, the way your midfield carried the ball up through the middle so confidently, if you can carry on like that you'll have a great season. I think you'll have a few thrashings where you'll tear teams apart playing like that, with a bit of luck on the day."

Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,Wow! Manure got battered here. Clear pen if ever I saw one. Another season of awful refereeing it appears.
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,We can all moan about the peno but all those shots no goal is concerning
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,"Might do OK at Championship level Wolves, won""t score enough at this high level."
Youtube,Manchester United vs. Wolves August 15,Wolves,I thought Wolves would miss Neves Moutino and Jimenez but they look good. Nunez Cunha and neto look good. Cunha can become really good player. They didn't call the penalty because it's Man United. They do this all the time against Wolves. Not fair
