Even with three points I would as Spurs fan have alarm bell ringing. Not being able to score a goal when the other team is nine men strong for 25 minutes and having virtually every referee decision in your favor the entire game is concerning. I think even with 10 men there would’ve been a pretty strong possibility of Liverpool winning against you guys, and I think almost a certainty with 11 on the pitch. I think if you takeoff the tinted glasses, it’d be fair to say that there are some pretty strong, questionable decisions that game."

That was the most corrupt game I have ever seen in my life 1. Lucho onside goal was ruled offside and we were NOT shown the lines 2. Jones tackle was a stil image on var screen for the referee to help him make up his mind? 3. Salah gets the ball of Destiny in the box but gets ruled as foul play?   I don't care who attacks me in this page but this can be you next time! Var and the officials are destroying this game. This is the worst corrupt i have EVER seen the premeir league!!!!!

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,So Easy 😂😂😂
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,That was a Marvellous Result for Spurs in the end. We won the Game as Liverpool went down to 9 Men. Mind you. Both Teams did work hard to avoid leaking Goals in. It was a good for Richarlison who found a Goal for Son. And in the end. We won the Game despite it was a own Goal. But I don't feel sorry for Liverpool as we haven't won the league for Donkeys years. And I have never seen Spurs win the League in my life at all.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Liam Lane Difference level.
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Wow. Just wow. What a last-minute winner can do. I have to admit, I was getting annoyed with us in the game. Not that we were playing badly, but in the most critical of moments, Liverpool were winning those key seconds at 10 men - and that was with us getting the benefit of refereeing decisions. Curtis Jones... I would've given a yellow, not a red. Simon Hooper gave a yellow - VAR got that wrong, for me. The disallowed goal for them at 0-0, it's a poor camera angle, and there's no lines when it looked onside... given offside. I don't understand that. Yves Bissouma - another yellow card. Good performance, but another booking. One more, and he's suspended, which we cannot have - particularly as Chelsea at home might fall into that suspension. Cristian Romero was slow at times, looking like his mind was elsewhere for a fraction of a second whenever I saw him, and I was wondering why Ange didn't make more changes earlier, given the man advantage and the schedule advantage - more legs, harder work for Liverpool, who did defend very well. I have to admit that, Liverpool deserved something out of that game, perhaps even a win. But the positives I take from that game is the win against nine men. We made it count in the end. Pedro Porro - I thought he was fantastic throughout the game even before the final moments, and for the goal we had disallowed, Maddison played one of the most beautiful passes I have ever seen - if only one Liverpool defender was a few yards further back. Mickey van de Ven had a good game, I felt - he was winning the races that he was involved in, and their attackers aren't that slow, either. And the manner of the result will raise the morale beyond belief.  17 points from a possible 21. We stay level on points with Arsenal while overtaking Liverpool - so next weekend is pivotal. Go and use the week wisely, beat Luton Town on Saturday at Kenilworth Road - they won today, but they play on Tuesday - and then let's see what happens between Arsenal and Manchester City next Sunday before the international break, because we're starting to see where certain teams will be at the end of the season."

How much they exceeded with the warnings, yet the exclusive argument is Allah’s only for those who want to remember or fear, but unfortunately, signs and warnings are of no use to a people who are not certain that Allah is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and earth, because of their belief in the theories of atheists about Lord of the worlds by naming Allah’s punishment “natural disasters”, Allah has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, and we say: What will you do when you find that the autumn is hotter than the summer months? But unfortunately, the signs and warnings do not avail for people who do not believe that Allah is in control of the kingdom of earth and heavens. O people of the climate summit against the disaster of Allah’s climate war, as if they are capable of changing the climate of planet earth! Rather, they allow climate change summits to be held in countries of the Muslims even though it violates the faith of Muslims! Have Muslims become atheists (denying) Allah’s existence, like the countries of the east and west, O people of the Middle East?! The atheists in the East, the West, and the Middle East will surely know who is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Is Allah in control, or are they in control?! Glory be to Allah, the Great, Who controls the kingdom of heavens and earth while they are humiliated disgracefully.  In any case, from now on, I announce the escalation in the matter of the autumn heat sign, by Allah’s command. You will find the autumn heat more intense than the summer heat for whoever desires to remember, and it will not cause remembrance to the worlds except upon whom my Lord have mercy, and none will remember except possessors of understanding-minds. As well, we announce from now on, by Allah’s command, the over-spread extreme heat of Saqar for the upcoming winter. Saqar, by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, Will surely raise the level of raging and roaring heat towards the planet earth from the south, southeast, and southwest, in order to raise Allah’s climate war disaster against the people of planet earth, by Allah’s command, on various types of Allah’s climate war disaster, on land and at sea. And as well with Allah’s command, the intense war escalation of Covid (Mateen) [firm plot from Allah] after the death of Xi Jinping, the President of China, and Allah’s command is preordained decree in the written Book. Let the criminals beware who want to extinguish Allah’s light in the East, West, and the Middle East. Verily, I swear by the Compeller of the heavens and earth, my Lord and your Lord Allah, the One and Subbuer, indeed Allah perfects His light, willingly or unwillingly, even if the criminals hate His prevail..

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed♨️☑️ ◾3️⃣◾ So call upon your gods, whom you worship instead of Allah, and let them remove from you the ravages of Allah’s universal and Corona war, if you are truthful. Here you have entered the summer of Saqar, so do not wait for the four well-known seasons after today. The summer of Saqar has overshadowed it all, including the winter of Antarctica and the coming winter, by the command of Allah. Do you think that I speak randomly of what I do not know? What a wonder, O community of non-Arabs and Arabs! For the fact with reason and logic, if Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni was truly one of those who were truthful in his announcement about the planet Earth’s entry into the climate of Hell planet Saqar, then the four seasons will definitely be eliminated so that you may understand, and oh glory be to Allah, my Lord and your Lord, He has the exclusive argument. Surely the raging of planet Saqar will be accomplished by the command of Allah as a mercy from Allah rather easier for you than your entry into it, perhaps this will bring about a remembrance for you. And by the command of Allah, hell will unleash rage and roar towards earth, covering the four directions (south, north, east, and west) because of the raging and roaring of the planet Saqar that passes over people at the horizons from time to time Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Furqãn] 25:12 {إِذَا رَأَتْهُم مِّن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُوا لَهَا تَغَيُّظًا وَزَفِيرًا ‎﴿١٢﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الفرقان]،  The fact of its passage is far from planet earth so it would never collide with earth, for the fact you will see the circle of planet Saqar when it rises from the far south-east to the far south-west, to the fact it will not collide with earth, but it is close in relation to cosmic space, and it will obscure the horizons of planet Earth from the four directions on the night of its passage, and you would also see obvious smoke in which there is a painful chastisement. So be watchful, for I am a watcher with you, and I know and am aware of what I say. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Dukhãn] 44:1-12 {حم ‎﴿١﴾‏ وَالْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ ‎﴿٢﴾‏ إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ ‎﴿٣﴾‏ فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ ‎﴿٤﴾‏ أَمْرًا مِّنْ عِندِنَا ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ ‎﴿٥﴾‏ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ ‎﴿٦﴾‏ رَبِّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ إِن كُنتُم مُّوقِنِينَ ‎﴿٧﴾‏ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ آبَائِكُمُ الْأَوَّلِينَ ‎﴿٨﴾‏ بَلْ هُمْ فِي شَكٍّ يَلْعَبُونَ ‎﴿٩﴾‏ فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِي السَّمَاءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ ‎﴿١٠﴾‏ يَغْشَى النَّاسَ ۖ هَٰذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ‎﴿١١﴾‏ رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مُؤْمِنُونَ ‎﴿١٢﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الدخان].  In any case, had it not been for planet Saqar that would not come to you except suddenly, I would have taught you when (it will come) on the night of its passage, but some humans are as cows that do not think; Instead of turning to their Lord to guide their hearts and ponder over the true call from their Lord, they delay their thoughts, minds, hearts, sight and hearing away from contemplating the True explanatory-statement of the grand Quran until they see the painful chastisement; such are like cattle of the jinn and mankind because they are atheists denying Allah’s attributes altogether, for the fact they are atheists denying Allah’s existence, how can they call on Him while they are atheists denying Him?! Hell is a refuge for them. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-A`arfã] 7:179-186.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"🔥🍁Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed🍁🔥 ◾1️⃣◾ In the name of Allah the All Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Single One, the Self-Subsistence on Whom all depend, He begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is equal to Him. Prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon the seal of prophets and messengers; Mohammad messenger of Allah, and upon all prophets of Allah and His messengers, and whoever followed them in their call to a common word among the servants (that there is no god but Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and we are His worshipers), then as for what follows..  O community of human nations, are you humans or cows that do not think? With my all due respect to any human being who respects his mind as a human being, in any case, by no means and never be guided of the jinn and humans who do not use their senses and hearts to contemplate the greatness of Allah Who created them, and for why He created them, and why He created everything around them of the heavens and the earth? We have entered into major universal challenges by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, which they cannot hide just as they concealed the challenges of the test for the sake of admonition and lesson. Anyway, O people of human nations, the greatest challenge has come by Allah’s command; so who would save you from Allah’s punishment if you are truthful? If you have gods that prevent you from the universal and Corona (afflictions); signs of Allah’s chastisement, then this is the time, if you are truthful. Glory be to Allah above what they associate with Him. For so long I was eager for the guidance of the worlds to worship Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and to not call upon anyone with Allah. Verily the Muslims refused, except to have intercessors in front of Allah, and they claim that Allah’s messenger Mohammad is their intercessor in front of Allah! Glory be to Allah, above what they associate, the Exalted Most High beyond measures. As for the majority of the worlds, they follow the atheists deniers of Allah who are possessors of nature’s wrath. Allah’s wrath is upon them and He has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, except whoever repents and turns to his Lord to guide his heart, he will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. So how can they believe in the wrath of nature while marginalizing Allah’s wrath upon them according to their belief?! They do not care about Allah’s wrath, and they do what displease Allah, and they put Allah behind their backs, as if Allah, Who created them and the heavens and the earth, and Who controls the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, does not exist in the belief of those who behold nature’s wrath, without paying at all any attention to Allah Lord of the worlds! Yet they are the little ones in the sight of Allah. Glory be to Allah the Great, Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. So what is the matter with you that you do not hope for Allah’s reverence?  As for the Christians, they exaggerated about the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary - servant of Allah and His Messenger - and they said: “Son of God,” just as the Jews previously exaggerated intentionally, and said: “Ozair is son of God,” and others of those upon whom wrath is brought down, they said: “Allah is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary.”! Glory be to Allah, the Exalted Most High, beyond measures, the One (there is nothing before Him), the Self-Subsistent on Whom all depend (there is no one more powerful than Allah), He did not beget, nor was He begotten, and there is no one equal to Him, so who is the one who will protect you from Allah’s chastisement if you are truthful? Those who hold the doctrine of nature’s wrath, they would never benefit you, for they could not be able to help you, nor they are able to help themselves. Surely, Allah has become angry for Himself and for His purpose, and you will know that Allah attains His purpose, so you would never find for yourselves helpers other than Allah. I was so keen to guide the misguided among the worlds who followed those upon whom wrath is brought down. How much I sought to guide all those who went astray, but they were not guided due to lack of use of (their) mind. And according to the fatwa from Allah about those who do not use their minds to understand the word of Allah in the grand Quran that it is the truth from their Lord, they would never understand it except with the language of chastisement from Allah, Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Esrã`a] 17:58-59 {وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا ‎﴿٥٨﴾وَمَا مَنَعَنَا أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ النَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۚ وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا تَخْوِيفًا ‎﴿٥٩﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الإسراء]. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed.. 09 - Rabi Awwal - 1445 AH Sep - 24 - 2023 AD 07:02 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns)  https://nasser-alyamani.org/showthread.php?p=428706  #In_the_name_of_Allah_the_One_the_Subduer.. #Urgent_to_every_human_and_each_who_has_intellect #Significant_event_an_admonishment_to_each_sane #Shanghai_Virus_Is_Torment     #TheWarningMoonIsOver #Omicron_is_a_global_calamity #Divine_Cosmic_n_Covidious_War #NoFlee_COVID_Of_DeathArrived ‎#WarningTo_Mohamed_Bin_Salman  _____________"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"🥵🥵🥵🌡️🌡️🌡️🔥🔥🔥  ⚠️SECRET OF CLIMATE TEMP. RAISE⚠️  👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 O community nations of humans, I am servant of Allah the One, the Subduer Who created jinn from flame of fire, and created man from dry clay like earthen pottery.  So often I warned you about the raising scale of Allah's universal and corona war, particularly in this current summer of yours, yet it did not raise awareness in you, and the reason is lack use of the mind, so let's ask the mind questions for which we want a logical answer.  So since the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni warns the humans of the passage of planet Saqar, since nineteen years ago while I warn and caution day and night, but my call only increased you in flight and distance from Allah more and more, so Allah blinded the insight of the Muslims and the disbelievers in the entire towns of humans except those on whom my Lord has mercy. Allah’s way (sunnah) for those who refused the mind use, consequently Allah would make their hearts deviate more and more. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Tawba] 9:115-116 {وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْمًا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَاهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا يَتَّقُونَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ ‎﴿١١٥﴾‏ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۚ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ ‎﴿١١٦﴾} صدق الله العظيم [سورة التوبة].  In any case, the humans have entered the lost time after the arrival of planet Saqar over the outskirts of the atmosphere of space of the (Antarctic) circle if the south pole, as we previously taught you years ago that Planet Saqar - when the decree of its intense approach comes - it will come from the south of the planet earth. Anyway, as long as humans entered the summer heat of Saqar, without exception. Verily, even those who have winter season at the South Pole, as that their winter season was annihilated to the fact they entered as well from among the worlds in the heat of Saqar’s summer. Indeed, we have taught you previously that humans entered the era of the summer of Saqar; so what is the matter with you, that you do not understand the news?! So keep your duty to Allah — O you who have eyesight, and preceded that we taught you about the planet Saqar of (fire) that it does not come to you except suddenly, so you would see it then you can not avert it.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"#الحل_لقارعه_حرب_كورونا_والمناخ #ClimateAndCoronaWarWayOut 📛🔥🦠🦠🔥📛📣 Quote 2 from a statement 21 ‘’ I call on Allah the One, the Subduer, to bear witness that I am the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni khalifa of Allah. I declare the absolute disbelief in the theory of global warming, and a fatwa of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni has preceded since sixteen years ago that the if the worlds turn away from Allah’s khalifa Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni surely Allah will declare the war against them, He began with war of skirmishes by the planet of chastisement from a distant place yet it became much nearer that it was previously before sixteen years ago and number of months, and it is now skirmishing with the sun, moon and earth,so Allah raised the level of Allah’s climate war disaster; air, sea and land in addition to the chastisement of Al-Ba-ooa some tiny creature that you do not encompass knowledge about it. O children of Adam, that’s Ba-ooda of blood which you call it coronavirus yet it is not corona, in fact they are living creatures, smart, fashioned and marked by Allah’s words, it lives by itself in land, sea and air. Indeed, that corona is from the minor chastisement disasters so the people may turn to Allah, and believe in Allah, Him Alone, no partner for Him, and to worship Him Alone, no partner for Him, and to obey Allah and His khalifa Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, but unfortunately up to now. Allah’s minor chastisement did not increase them except denying Allah Lord of the worlds as if Allah is not mentioned a thing - glory be to Him and He is highly exalted above what they associate (with Him) beyond measure - as if you are in control over the kingdom of the heaven and earth to stop Allah’s climate war disaster! Glory be to Allah the Great. By Allah, again by Allah, you can not be in control over Allah’s minutest soldiers in the Book; Ba-ooda of blood and its descendants altogether, and by no means the quarantines would ever benefit after today! Allah only was content by imprisoning you initially and cutting off your sustenance, or do you think that you will return to quarantine and shutting down so Allah would relieve you as He did before?! Preceded that we issued a fatwa to you that the war of the blood Ba-ooda’s descendants of what you call it corona; it is directly by Allah’s leadership receiving the commands from its Lord then they do what they are commanded. I deliver the news to you that your vaccines will end with complete failure being useless and you will surely throw your vaccines into the dump because simply you would never find a loyal-friend who prevents you from Allah’s chastisement nor a protector from His chastisement. ’’ It’s a quote from a new statement Written by Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni intitled (Solution for corona and climate war disaster) 24 - Dhul Hijjah -1442 AH 03-08-2021 AD 11:28 AM (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns) _____________ read more by typing the title of this statement which appeared at the top of this comment in google search.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"♦️✍ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani   🔹️ Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed 🔹️  ♦️ We will conclude this statement by recalling verses from Surah Al-Qamar to ponder over and contemplate for those who he wills to remember from possessors of understanding minds. What Allah did to the first nations. Did Allah destroy them by cosmic means, or was it just natural disasters? So think and ponder; Did Allah destroy them through natural disasters by Allah’s command? Disasters of nature are not from itself, in fact by the command of Allah Who controls the kingdom of nature, so ponder over the word, O possessors of understanding minds.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"I feel both sets of fans and neutrals were a little ripped off by a couple of decisions. The Diaz goal in particular, the cards I’m ok with but the first yellow on Jota was soft.   Spurs were right in that match and it was entertaining to watch. If we had to come back from 2-1 down versus 10 men it would have been a cracker second half, with Liverpool still dangerous. Instead the game will be remembered for the VAR and refs and that’s not fair to Spurs who had to play what was in front of them."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,🚨🚨| BREAKING: PGMOL statement on Luis Diaz goal:   “PGMOL acknowledge significant human error during Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool. The goal by Luiz Diaz was disallowed for offside by the on-field team of match officials. This was a clear and obvious factual error and should have resulted in the goal being awarded.     No wonder They don't Officiate UEFA champions league and world cup
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"The fact that Spurs fans are out here actually defending this and pretending they did something good by rescuing 3 points after the textbook matchfixing that occurred and not even being able to beat a team down to 9 men who had a clean goal stolen off them to put them 2-1 up without an own goal in the last 10 seconds is all you ever need to see to know why this loser club full of clown support never wins anything 🤣🤣🤣 you're all clowns the lot of you, enjoy your three points because it's trophyless days like this that you need to be content with"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Logan Rees if Biss doesn’t manage to take the pressure off by hyper extending his knee he’s at real risk of a broken leg. It wasn’t Jones releasing the pressure on the leg, his foot was still pushing forwards with momentum. Like I said not his fault nor intent but these are always given as red when studs going into the planted leg.   Agree to disagree though.   Swings and roundabouts happen fast, from last week where Nketiah should have been sent off for a much worse challenge. Too much inconsistency by far in the game."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Announcing the continuation of Saqar’s summer; a warning to humans  In the name of Allah the All Merciful, the Most Merciful, the One, the Subduer, He creates whom He pleases, prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon the seal of prophets and messengers; Mohammad messenger of Allah, and upon all righteous of Allah’s servants among the nations of Allah’s kingdom altogether; that stride (on land) or fly, and among the ancients, also among the upper assembly till judgment day, then after this..   Let both sin-laden [mankind and jinn] bear witness, surely Allah is sufficient as a witness for a fact that I do not speak except the truth from Allah, and since I know from Allah what you do not know, I announce to the worlds the continuation of Saqar’s summer that entered this year of yours 2023 AD, and I announce that autumn season is hotter than summer season.  Perhaps the entire population of humans would like to say: “Oh the Subtle One, oh the Subtle One! So how can the autumn heat be more intense than the summer heat? We are counting with fingers to enter autumn to begin the moderation of temperature levels. O Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, are you babbling about what you do not know? Since when is the heat of autumn more intense than the heat of summer?!”.  Then replies to you the national international Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, and I say: It’s not the heat of the planet Saqar that you can hide just as you hide the signs of admonitions to take a lesson for the dingy disease, the difficult Corona, and those who hinder others will die in their rage, surely then you will know that indeed we are truthful.  O community of non-Arabs and Arabs, did I not tell you that you have entered the summer of Saqar in this current year of yours, 2023 AD? Since they cannot hide the continued summer of Saqar until the night of passage of planet Saqar, it would obscure the sky from earth, starting with the celestial eclipse from the south side, southeast, and southwest. It would spread over the west and east. Accordingly with Allah’s permission, we will make the equation a mathematics (1 + 1 = 2). Indeed, since I know from Allah what you do not know, therefore you will not find that I make return lines like you do, or say that I predict, or say that I assume theories like (the meteorologists) climate scientists holders of global warming theories due to carbon dioxide, according to the fatwa of the United Nations Climate Organization. They know that it is unscientific and illogical - the theory of global warming holders, but they do not find what they say about the cause for the rise in temperature levels of the planet earth, because they do not know, certainly far from, very far.  In fact I am khalifa of Allah; the national international Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, I announce to the worlds that the intense summer of Saqar; the most grievous and more bitter will sweep through the coming winter, thus destroying winter in the (Arctic) circle of the north pole, the dwelling of the worlds, for the fact the worlds are impatiently awaiting the coming winter with extreme patience, and for that I announce to the worlds from what my Lord has taught me, that you will find, starting from (December 21) of this year, 2023 AD, that the winter season is much hotter, because those who do not reason will not take a lesson from the heat of the autumn season when they find that the autumn is hottest than the ended summer. The entire planet earth with its both poles (the southern pole (Antarctic) circle, the northern pole (Arctic) circle, and the Middle East) has entered the summer of Saqar.  So when will you understand the news that you truly entered the direct summer of Saqar so you would say: Allah spoke the truth Also His khalifa, the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni? How much they exceeded with the warnings, yet the exclusive argument is Allah’s only for those who want to remember or fear, but unfortunately, signs and warnings are of no use to a people who are not certain that Allah is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and earth, because of their belief in the theories of atheists about Lord of the worlds by naming Allah’s punishment “natural disasters”, Allah has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, and we say: What will you do when you find that the autumn is hotter than the summer months? But unfortunately, the signs and warnings do not avail for people who do not believe that Allah is in control of the kingdom of earth and heavens. O people of the climate summit against the disaster of Allah’s climate war, as if they are capable of changing the climate of planet earth! Rather, they allow climate change summits to be held in countries of the Muslims even though it violates the faith of Muslims! Have Muslims become atheists (denying) Allah’s existence, like the countries of the east and west, O people of the Middle East?! The atheists in the East, the West, and the Middle East will surely know who is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Is Allah in control, or are they in control?! Glory be to Allah, the Great, Who controls the kingdom of heavens and earth while they are humiliated disgracefully.  In any case, from now on, I announce the escalation in the matter of the autumn heat sign, by Allah’s command. You will find the autumn heat more intense than the summer heat for whoever desires to remember, and it will not cause remembrance to the worlds except upon whom my Lord have mercy, and none will remember except possessors of understanding-minds. As well, we announce from now on, by Allah’s command, the over-spread extreme heat of Saqar for the upcoming winter. Saqar, by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, Will surely raise the level of raging and roaring heat towards the planet earth from the south, southeast, and southwest, in order to raise Allah’s climate war disaster against the people of planet earth, by Allah’s command, on various types of Allah’s climate war disaster, on land and at sea. And as well with Allah’s command, the intense war escalation of Covid (Mateen) [firm plot from Allah] after the death of Xi Jinping, the President of China, and Allah’s command is preordained decree in the written Book. Let the criminals beware who want to extinguish Allah’s light in the East, West, and the Middle East. Verily, I swear by the Compeller of the heavens and earth, my Lord and your Lord Allah, the One and Subbuer, indeed Allah perfects His light, willingly or unwillingly, even if the criminals hate His prevail..  Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni 26 - Safar - 1445 AH Sep. 11 - 2023 AD 06:55 am  To read the full statement in clear and coordinated writing from the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani kindly click the below link"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"☑️♨️Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed♨️☑️ ◾3️⃣◾ So call upon your gods, whom you worship instead of Allah, and let them remove from you the ravages of Allah’s universal and Corona war, if you are truthful. Here you have entered the summer of Saqar, so do not wait for the four well-known seasons after today. The summer of Saqar has overshadowed it all, including the winter of Antarctica and the coming winter, by the command of Allah. Do you think that I speak randomly of what I do not know? What a wonder, O community of non-Arabs and Arabs! For the fact with reason and logic, if Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni was truly one of those who were truthful in his announcement about the planet Earth’s entry into the climate of Hell planet Saqar, then the four seasons will definitely be eliminated so that you may understand, and oh glory be to Allah, my Lord and your Lord, He has the exclusive argument. Surely the raging of planet Saqar will be accomplished by the command of Allah as a mercy from Allah rather easier for you than your entry into it, perhaps this will bring about a remembrance for you. And by the command of Allah, hell will unleash rage and roar towards earth, covering the four directions (south, north, east, and west) because of the raging and roaring of the planet Saqar that passes over people at the horizons from time to time Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Furqãn] 25:12 {إِذَا رَأَتْهُم مِّن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُوا لَهَا تَغَيُّظًا وَزَفِيرًا ‎﴿١٢﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الفرقان]،  The fact of its passage is far from planet earth so it would never collide with earth, for the fact you will see the circle of planet Saqar when it rises from the far south-east to the far south-west, to the fact it will not collide with earth, but it is close in relation to cosmic space, and it will obscure the horizons of planet Earth from the four directions on the night of its passage, and you would also see obvious smoke in which there is a painful chastisement. So be watchful, for I am a watcher with you, and I know and am aware of what I say. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Dukhãn] 44:1-12 {حم ‎﴿١﴾‏ وَالْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ ‎﴿٢﴾‏ إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ ‎﴿٣﴾‏ فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ ‎﴿٤﴾‏ أَمْرًا مِّنْ عِندِنَا ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ ‎﴿٥﴾‏ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ ‎﴿٦﴾‏ رَبِّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ إِن كُنتُم مُّوقِنِينَ ‎﴿٧﴾‏ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ آبَائِكُمُ الْأَوَّلِينَ ‎﴿٨﴾‏ بَلْ هُمْ فِي شَكٍّ يَلْعَبُونَ ‎﴿٩﴾‏ فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِي السَّمَاءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ ‎﴿١٠﴾‏ يَغْشَى النَّاسَ ۖ هَٰذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ‎﴿١١﴾‏ رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مُؤْمِنُونَ ‎﴿١٢﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الدخان].  In any case, had it not been for planet Saqar that would not come to you except suddenly, I would have taught you when (it will come) on the night of its passage, but some humans are as cows that do not think; Instead of turning to their Lord to guide their hearts and ponder over the true call from their Lord, they delay their thoughts, minds, hearts, sight and hearing away from contemplating the True explanatory-statement of the grand Quran until they see the painful chastisement; such are like cattle of the jinn and mankind because they are atheists denying Allah’s attributes altogether, for the fact they are atheists denying Allah’s existence, how can they call on Him while they are atheists denying Him?! Hell is a refuge for them. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-A`arfã] 7:179-186. The fact, you see Allah’s signs upon the actual reality, but pride carries you off to sin then you turn away. {وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنسِ ۖ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَانٌ لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ ‎﴿١٧٩﴾‏ وَلِلَّهِ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَائِهِ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ ‎﴿١٨٠﴾‏ وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ ‎﴿١٨١﴾‏وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ‎﴿١٨٢﴾‏ وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ ‎﴿١٨٣﴾‏ أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُوا ۗ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ ۚ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ ‎﴿١٨٤﴾‏ أَوَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا فِي مَلَكُوتِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ قَدِ اقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ ۖ فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ ‎﴿١٨٥﴾‏ مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَا هَادِيَ لَهُ ۚ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ ‎﴿١٨٦﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الأعراف]  ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed.. 09 - Rabi Awwal - 1445 AH Sep - 24 - 2023 AD 07:02 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns)  https://nasser-alyamani.org/showthread.php?p=428706  #In_the_name_of_Allah_the_One_the_Subduer.. #Urgent_to_every_human_and_each_who_has_intellect #Significant_event_an_admonishment_to_each_sane #Shanghai_Virus_Is_Torment     #TheWarningMoonIsOver #Omicron_is_a_global_calamity #Divine_Cosmic_n_Covidious_War #NoFlee_COVID_Of_DeathArrived ‎#WarningTo_Mohamed_Bin_Salman  _____________"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"🔴♦️Announcing the continuation of Saqar’s summer; a warning to humans♦️🔴 #quote✒2️⃣✒️  In fact I am khalifa of Allah; the national international Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, I announce to the worlds that the intense summer of Saqar; the most grievous and more bitter will sweep through the coming winter, thus destroying winter in the (Arctic) circle of the north pole, the dwelling of the worlds, for the fact the worlds are impatiently awaiting the coming winter with extreme patience, and for that I announce to the worlds from what my Lord has taught me, that you will find, starting from (December 21) of this year, 2023 AD, that the winter season is much hotter, because those who do not reason will not take a lesson from the heat of the autumn season when they find that the autumn is hottest than the ended summer. The entire planet earth with its both poles (the southern pole (Antarctic) circle, the northern pole (Arctic) circle, and the Middle East) has entered the summer of Saqar.  So when will you understand the news that you truly entered the direct summer of Saqar so you would say: Allah spoke the truth Also His khalifa, the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni? How much they exceeded with the warnings, yet the exclusive argument is Allah’s only for those who want to remember or fear, but unfortunately, signs and warnings are of no use to a people who are not certain that Allah is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and earth, because of their belief in the theories of atheists about Lord of the worlds by naming Allah’s punishment “natural disasters”, Allah has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, and we say: What will you do when you find that the autumn is hotter than the summer months? But unfortunately, the signs and warnings do not avail for people who do not believe that Allah is in control of the kingdom of earth and heavens. O people of the climate summit against the disaster of Allah’s climate war, as if they are capable of changing the climate of planet earth! Rather, they allow climate change summits to be held in countries of the Muslims even though it violates the faith of Muslims! Have Muslims become atheists (denying) Allah’s existence, like the countries of the east and west, O people of the Middle East?! The atheists in the East, the West, and the Middle East will surely know who is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Is Allah in control, or are they in control?! Glory be to Allah, the Great, Who controls the kingdom of heavens and earth while they are humiliated disgracefully.  In any case, from now on, I announce the escalation in the matter of the autumn heat sign, by Allah’s command. You will find the autumn heat more intense than the summer heat for whoever desires to remember, and it will not cause remembrance to the worlds except upon whom my Lord have mercy, and none will remember except possessors of understanding-minds. As well, we announce from now on, by Allah’s command, the over-spread extreme heat of Saqar for the upcoming winter. Saqar, by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, Will surely raise the level of raging and roaring heat towards the planet earth from the south, southeast, and southwest, in order to raise Allah’s climate war disaster against the people of planet earth, by Allah’s command, on various types of Allah’s climate war disaster, on land and at sea. And as well with Allah’s command, the intense war escalation of Covid (Mateen) [firm plot from Allah] after the death of Xi Jinping, the President of China, and Allah’s command is preordained decree in the written Book. Let the criminals beware who want to extinguish Allah’s light in the East, West, and the Middle East. Verily, I swear by the Compeller of the heavens and earth, my Lord and your Lord Allah, the One and Subbuer, indeed Allah perfects His light, willingly or unwillingly, even if the criminals hate His prevail..

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Tottenham Hotspur 🔥🍁Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed🍁🔥 ◾1️⃣◾ In the name of Allah the All Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Single One, the Self-Subsistence on Whom all depend, He begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is equal to Him. Prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon the seal of prophets and messengers; Mohammad messenger of Allah, and upon all prophets of Allah and His messengers, and whoever followed them in their call to a common word among the servants (that there is no god but Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and we are His worshipers), then as for what follows..  O community of human nations, are you humans or cows that do not think? With my all due respect to any human being who respects his mind as a human being, in any case, by no means and never be guided of the jinn and humans who do not use their senses and hearts to contemplate the greatness of Allah Who created them, and for why He created them, and why He created everything around them of the heavens and the earth? We have entered into major universal challenges by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, which they cannot hide just as they concealed the challenges of the test for the sake of admonition and lesson. Anyway, O people of human nations, the greatest challenge has come by Allah’s command; so who would save you from Allah’s punishment if you are truthful? If you have gods that prevent you from the universal and Corona (afflictions); signs of Allah’s chastisement, then this is the time, if you are truthful. Glory be to Allah above what they associate with Him. For so long I was eager for the guidance of the worlds to worship Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and to not call upon anyone with Allah. Verily the Muslims refused, except to have intercessors in front of Allah, and they claim that Allah’s messenger Mohammad is their intercessor in front of Allah! Glory be to Allah, above what they associate, the Exalted Most High beyond measures. As for the majority of the worlds, they follow the atheists deniers of Allah who are possessors of nature’s wrath. Allah’s wrath is upon them and He has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, except whoever repents and turns to his Lord to guide his heart, he will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. So how can they believe in the wrath of nature while marginalizing Allah’s wrath upon them according to their belief?! They do not care about Allah’s wrath, and they do what displease Allah, and they put Allah behind their backs, as if Allah, Who created them and the heavens and the earth, and Who controls the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, does not exist in the belief of those who behold nature’s wrath, without paying at all any attention to Allah Lord of the worlds! Yet they are the little ones in the sight of Allah. Glory be to Allah the Great, Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. So what is the matter with you that you do not hope for Allah’s reverence?  As for the Christians, they exaggerated about the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary - servant of Allah and His Messenger - and they said: “Son of God,” just as the Jews previously exaggerated intentionally, and said: “Ozair is son of God,” and others of those upon whom wrath is brought down, they said: “Allah is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary.”! Glory be to Allah, the Exalted Most High, beyond measures, the One (there is nothing before Him), the Self-Subsistent on Whom all depend (there is no one more powerful than Allah), He did not beget, nor was He begotten, and there is no one equal to Him, so who is the one who will protect you from Allah’s chastisement if you are truthful? Those who hold the doctrine of nature’s wrath, they would never benefit you, for they could not be able to help you, nor they are able to help themselves. Surely, Allah has become angry for Himself and for His purpose, and you will know that Allah attains His purpose, so you would never find for yourselves helpers other than Allah. I was so keen to guide the misguided among the worlds who followed those upon whom wrath is brought down. How much I sought to guide all those who went astray, but they were not guided due to lack of use of (their) mind. And according to the fatwa from Allah about those who do not use their minds to understand the word of Allah in the grand Quran that it is the truth from their Lord, they would never understand it except with the language of chastisement from Allah, Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Esrã`a] 17:58-59 {وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا ‎﴿٥٨﴾وَمَا مَنَعَنَا أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ النَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۚ وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا تَخْوِيفًا ‎﴿٥٩﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الإسراء]. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed.. 09 - Rabi Awwal - 1445 AH Sep - 24 - 2023 AD 07:02 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns)  https://nasser-alyamani.org/showthread.php?p=428706  #In_the_name_of_Allah_the_One_the_Subduer.. #Urgent_to_every_human_and_each_who_has_intellect #Significant_event_an_admonishment_to_each_sane #Shanghai_Virus_Is_Torment     #TheWarningMoonIsOver #Omicron_is_a_global_calamity #Divine_Cosmic_n_Covidious_War #NoFlee_COVID_Of_DeathArrived ‎#WarningTo_Mohamed_Bin_Salman  _____________"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Red cards. They're are needed but can have an adverse effect on games. This was lining up to be an epic game. Ol mate goes over the ball defo red card. 2nd yellow ref card..no issue. Offside though..he was onside all day every day and twice on Sunday.  An own goal to finish a very resilient Liverpool. Their luck was all bad today.  Why Kulu stayed the course I don't know. Porro finally showing him how to cross.  Some great football from both sides again VAR takes the headlines. It needs scrapping.  Can't blame Spurs pool fans. We played well.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"♦️✍ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani   🔹️ Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed 🔹️  ♦️ We will conclude this statement by recalling verses from Surah Al-Qamar to ponder over and contemplate for those who he wills to remember from possessors of understanding minds. What Allah did to the first nations. Did Allah destroy them by cosmic means, or was it just natural disasters? So think and ponder; Did Allah destroy them through natural disasters by Allah’s command? Disasters of nature are not from itself, in fact by the command of Allah Who controls the kingdom of nature, so ponder over the word, O possessors of understanding minds. Allah the Most High said: [Al-Qamar] 54:9-49 {كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ فَكَذَّبُوا عَبْدَنَا وَقَالُوا مَجْنُونٌ وَازْدُجِرَ ‎﴿٩﴾‏ فَدَعَا رَبَّهُ أَنِّي مَغْلُوبٌ فَانتَصِرْ ‎﴿١٠﴾‏ فَفَتَحْنَا أَبْوَابَ السَّمَاءِ بِمَاءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ ‎﴿١١﴾‏ وَفَجَّرْنَا الْأَرْضَ عُيُونًا فَالْتَقَى الْمَاءُ عَلَىٰ أَمْرٍ قَدْ قُدِرَ ‎﴿١٢﴾‏ وَحَمَلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ ذَاتِ أَلْوَاحٍ وَدُسُرٍ ‎﴿١٣﴾‏ تَجْرِي بِأَعْيُنِنَا جَزَاءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ ‎﴿١٤﴾‏ وَلَقَد تَّرَكْنَاهَا آيَةً فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ ‎﴿١٥﴾‏ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ ‎﴿١٦﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ ‎﴿١٧﴾‏ كَذَّبَتْ عَادٌ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ ‎﴿١٨﴾‏ إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحًا صَرْصَرًا فِي يَوْمِ نَحْسٍ مُّسْتَمِرٍّ ‎﴿١٩﴾‏ تَنزِعُ النَّاسَ كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ مُّنقَعِرٍ ‎﴿٢٠﴾‏ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ ‎﴿٢١﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ ‎﴿٢٢﴾‏ كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِالنُّذُرِ ‎﴿٢٣﴾‏ فَقَالُوا أَبَشَرًا مِّنَّا وَاحِدًا نَّتَّبِعُهُ إِنَّا إِذًا لَّفِي ضَلَالٍ وَسُعُرٍ ‎﴿٢٤﴾‏ أَأُلْقِيَ الذِّكْرُ عَلَيْهِ مِن بَيْنِنَا بَلْ هُوَ كَذَّابٌ أَشِرٌ ‎﴿٢٥﴾‏ سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَدًا مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الْأَشِرُ ‎﴿٢٦﴾‏ إِنَّا مُرْسِلُو النَّاقَةِ فِتْنَةً لَّهُمْ فَارْتَقِبْهُمْ وَاصْطَبِرْ ‎﴿٢٧﴾‏وَنَبِّئْهُمْ أَنَّ الْمَاءَ قِسْمَةٌ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ كُلُّ شِرْبٍ مُّحْتَضَرٌ ‎﴿٢٨﴾‏ فَنَادَوْا صَاحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَىٰ فَعَقَرَ ‎﴿٢٩﴾‏ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ ‎﴿٣٠﴾‏ إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ صَيْحَةً وَاحِدَةً فَكَانُوا كَهَشِيمِ الْمُحْتَظِرِ ‎﴿٣١﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ ‎﴿٣٢﴾‏ كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ لُوطٍ بِالنُّذُرِ ‎﴿٣٣﴾‏ إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ حَاصِبًا إِلَّا آلَ لُوطٍ ۖ نَّجَّيْنَاهُم بِسَحَرٍ ‎﴿٣٤﴾‏ نِّعْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي مَن شَكَرَ ‎﴿٣٥﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ أَنذَرَهُم بَطْشَتَنَا فَتَمَارَوْا بِالنُّذُرِ ‎﴿٣٦﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ رَاوَدُوهُ عَن ضَيْفِهِ فَطَمَسْنَا أَعْيُنَهُمْ فَذُوقُوا عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ ‎﴿٣٧﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ صَبَّحَهُم بُكْرَةً عَذَابٌ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ ‎﴿٣٨﴾‏ فَذُوقُوا عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ ‎﴿٣٩﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ ‎﴿٤٠﴾‏ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَ آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ النُّذُرُ ‎﴿٤١﴾‏ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا كُلِّهَا فَأَخَذْنَاهُمْ أَخْذَ عَزِيزٍ مُّقْتَدِرٍ ‎﴿٤٢﴾‏ أَكُفَّارُكُمْ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أُولَٰئِكُمْ أَمْ لَكُم بَرَاءَةٌ فِي الزُّبُرِ ‎﴿٤٣﴾‏ أَمْ يَقُولُونَ نَحْنُ جَمِيعٌ مُّنتَصِرٌ ‎﴿٤٤﴾‏ سَيُهْزَمُ الْجَمْعُ وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُرَ ‎﴿٤٥﴾‏ بَلِ السَّاعَةُ مَوْعِدُهُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ أَدْهَىٰ وَأَمَرُّ ‎﴿٤٦﴾‏ إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِي ضَلَالٍ وَسُعُرٍ ‎﴿٤٧﴾‏ يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِي النَّارِ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُوا مَسَّ سَقَرَ ‎﴿٤٨﴾‏ إِنَّا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقْنَاهُ بِقَدَرٍ ‎﴿٤٩﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة القمر].

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"☑️♨️Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed♨️☑️ ◾3️⃣◾ So call upon your gods, whom you worship instead of Allah, and let them remove from you the ravages of Allah’s universal and Corona war, if you are truthful. Here you have entered the summer of Saqar, so do not wait for the four well-known seasons after today. The summer of Saqar has overshadowed it all, including the winter of Antarctica and the coming winter, by the command of Allah. Do you think that I speak randomly of what I do not know? What a wonder, O community of non-Arabs and Arabs! For the fact with reason and logic, if Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni was truly one of those who were truthful in his announcement about the planet Earth’s entry into the climate of Hell planet Saqar, then the four seasons will definitely be eliminated so that you may understand, and oh glory be to Allah, my Lord and your Lord, He has the exclusive argument. Surely the raging of planet Saqar will be accomplished by the command of Allah as a mercy from Allah rather easier for you than your entry into it, perhaps this will bring about a remembrance for you. And by the command of Allah, hell will unleash rage and roar towards earth, covering the four directions (south, north, east, and west) because of the raging and roaring of the planet Saqar that passes over people at the horizons from time to time Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Furqãn] 25:12 {إِذَا رَأَتْهُم مِّن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُوا لَهَا تَغَيُّظًا وَزَفِيرًا ‎﴿١٢﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الفرقان]،  The fact of its passage is far from planet earth so it would never collide with earth, for the fact you will see the circle of planet Saqar when it rises from the far south-east to the far south-west, to the fact it will not collide with earth, but it is close in relation to cosmic space, and it will obscure the horizons of planet Earth from the four directions on the night of its passage, and you would also see obvious smoke in which there is a painful chastisement. So be watchful, for I am a watcher with you, and I know and am aware of what I say. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Dukhãn] 44:1-12 {حم ‎﴿١﴾‏ وَالْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ ‎﴿٢﴾‏ إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ ‎﴿٣﴾‏ فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ ‎﴿٤﴾‏ أَمْرًا مِّنْ عِندِنَا ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ ‎﴿٥﴾‏ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ ‎﴿٦﴾‏ رَبِّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ إِن كُنتُم مُّوقِنِينَ ‎﴿٧﴾‏ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ آبَائِكُمُ الْأَوَّلِينَ ‎﴿٨﴾‏ بَلْ هُمْ فِي شَكٍّ يَلْعَبُونَ ‎﴿٩﴾‏ فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِي السَّمَاءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ ‎﴿١٠﴾‏ يَغْشَى النَّاسَ ۖ هَٰذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ‎﴿١١﴾‏ رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مُؤْمِنُونَ ‎﴿١٢﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الدخان].  In any case, had it not been for planet Saqar that would not come to you except suddenly, I would have taught you when (it will come) on the night of its passage, but some humans are as cows that do not think; Instead of turning to their Lord to guide their hearts and ponder over the true call from their Lord, they delay their thoughts, minds, hearts, sight and hearing away from contemplating the True explanatory-statement of the grand Quran until they see the painful chastisement; such are like cattle of the jinn and mankind because they are atheists denying Allah’s attributes altogether, for the fact they are atheists denying Allah’s existence, how can they call on Him while they are atheists denying Him?! Hell is a refuge for them. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-A`arfã] 7:179-186. The fact, you see Allah’s signs upon the actual reality, but pride carries you off to sin then you turn away. {وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنسِ ۖ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَانٌ لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ ‎﴿١٧٩﴾‏ وَلِلَّهِ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَائِهِ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ ‎﴿١٨٠﴾‏ وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ ‎﴿١٨١﴾‏وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ‎﴿١٨٢﴾‏ وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ ‎﴿١٨٣﴾‏ أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُوا ۗ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ ۚ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ ‎﴿١٨٤﴾‏ أَوَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا فِي مَلَكُوتِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ قَدِ اقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ ۖ فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ ‎﴿١٨٥﴾‏ مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَا هَادِيَ لَهُ ۚ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ ‎﴿١٨٦﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الأعراف]  ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed.. 09 - Rabi Awwal - 1445 AH Sep - 24 - 2023 AD 07:02 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns)  https:/*/nasser-alyamani.org/showthread.php?p=428706  #In_the_name_of_Allah_the_One_the_Subduer.. #Urgent_to_every_human_and_each_who_has_intellect #Significant_event_an_admonishment_to_each_sane #Shanghai_Virus_Is_Torment     #TheWarningMoonIsOver #Omicron_is_a_global_calamity #Divine_Cosmic_n_Covidious_War #NoFlee_COVID_Of_DeathArrived ‎#WarningTo_Mohamed_Bin_Salman  _____________ تng46y333"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Sakil Khan qismat e kharap 😪
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"🔥🍁Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed🍁🔥 ◾1️⃣◾ In the name of Allah the All Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Single One, the Self-Subsistence on Whom all depend, He begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is equal to Him. Prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon the seal of prophets and messengers; Mohammad messenger of Allah, and upon all prophets of Allah and His messengers, and whoever followed them in their call to a common word among the servants (that there is no god but Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and we are His worshipers), then as for what follows.. O community of human nations, are you humans or cows that do not think? With my all due respect to any human being who respects his mind as a human being, in any case, by no means and never be guided of the jinn and humans who do not use their senses and hearts to contemplate the greatness of Allah Who created them, and for why He created them, and why He created everything around them of the heavens and the earth? We have entered into major universal challenges by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, which they cannot hide just as they concealed the challenges of the test for the sake of admonition and lesson. Anyway, O people of human nations, the greatest challenge has come by Allah’s command; so who would save you from Allah’s punishment if you are truthful? If you have gods that prevent you from the universal and Corona (afflictions); signs of Allah’s chastisement, then this is the time, if you are truthful. Glory be to Allah above what they associate with Him. For so long I was eager for the guidance of the worlds to worship Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and to not call upon anyone with Allah. Verily the Muslims refused, except to have intercessors in front of Allah, and they claim that Allah’s messenger Mohammad is their intercessor in front of Allah! Glory be to Allah, above what they associate, the Exalted Most High beyond measures. As for the majority of the worlds, they follow the atheists deniers of Allah who are possessors of nature’s wrath. Allah’s wrath is upon them and He has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, except whoever repents and turns to his Lord to guide his heart, he will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. So how can they believe in the wrath of nature while marginalizing Allah’s wrath upon them according to their belief?! They do not care about Allah’s wrath, and they do what displease Allah, and they put Allah behind their backs, as if Allah, Who created them and the heavens and the earth, and Who controls the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, does not exist in the belief of those who behold nature’s wrath, without paying at all any attention to Allah Lord of the worlds! Yet they are the little ones in the sight of Allah. Glory be to Allah the Great, Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. So what is the matter with you that you do not hope for Allah’s reverence? As for the Christians, they exaggerated about the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary - servant of Allah and His Messenger - and they said: “Son of God,” just as the Jews previously exaggerated intentionally, and said: “Ozair is son of God,” and others of those upon whom wrath is brought down, they said: “Allah is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary.”! Glory be to Allah, the Exalted Most High, beyond measures, the One (there is nothing before Him), the Self-Subsistent on Whom all depend (there is no one more powerful than Allah), He did not beget, nor was He begotten, and there is no one equal to Him, so who is the one who will protect you from Allah’s chastisement if you are truthful? Those who hold the doctrine of nature’s wrath, they would never benefit you, for they could not be able to help you, nor they are able to help themselves. Surely, Allah has become angry for Himself and for His purpose, and you will know that Allah attains His purpose, so you would never find for yourselves helpers other than Allah. I was so keen to guide the misguided among the worlds who followed those upon whom wrath is brought down. How much I sought to guide all those who went astray, but they were not guided due to lack of use of (their) mind. And according to the fatwa from Allah about those who do not use their minds to understand the word of Allah in the grand Quran that it is the truth from their Lord, they would never understand it except with the language of chastisement from Allah, Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Esrã`a] 17:58-59 {وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا ‎﴿٥٨﴾وَمَا مَنَعَنَا أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ النَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۚ وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا تَخْوِيفًا ‎﴿٥٩﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الإسراء]. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed.. 09 - Rabi Awwal - 1445 AH Sep - 24 - 2023 AD 07:02 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns) #In_the_name_of_Allah_the_One_the_Subduer.. #Urgent_to_every_human_and_each_who_has_intellect #Significant_event_an_admonishment_to_each_sane #Shanghai_Virus_Is_Torment #TheWarningMoonIsOver #Omicron_is_a_global_calamity #Divine_Cosmic_n_Covidious_War #NoFlee_COVID_Of_DeathArrived ‎#WarningTo_Mohamed_Bin_Salman _____________"

Yes Liverpool played with 9 player but they had 4 defender on post which is maximum number in football 🏈 and Tottenham have manage to score 2 goals and 24 shots against strong defense of Liverpool.     Yeah agreed 💯 percent 9 player affect Liverpool  As Liverpool attack before half Time was 10 shots and ends with 12 shots but that was results of their poor discipline of Liverpool as many  player Salah,Jota have lost control over themselves  4 yellow cards and 2 Red cards for Liverpool. So due to Poor discipline Liverpool lost 2 player that don't mean Tottenham Hotspur should Play with 9 players spurs maintain discipline as all 11 players were in field.    Tottenham have nothing do with VAR system as it was mistake of referee 😌. It's not that Liverpool haven't won controversial matches. Yesterday others team today Liverpool so there no sense of debating on system.  Moral of match is Liverfools crying 😭 will not change results. Match is over. It's 2-1 as spurs are winner 🏆🏆 Liverpool( Liverfools ) fan plz cry 😭😭 in corner 😌😂😂😂   #Tottenham #Spurs #sonheungmin"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"🥵🥵🥵🌡️🌡️🌡️🔥🔥🔥 🔥🍁Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed🍁🔥 ◾1️⃣◾ In the name of Allah the All Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Single One, the Self-Subsistence on Whom all depend, He begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is equal to Him. Prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon the seal of prophets and messengers; Mohammad messenger of Allah, and upon all prophets of Allah and His messengers, and whoever followed them in their call to a common word among the servants (that there is no god but Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and we are His worshipers), then as for what follows..  O community of human nations, are you humans or cows that do not think? With my all due respect to any human being who respects his mind as a human being, in any case, by no means and never be guided of the jinn and humans who do not use their senses and hearts to contemplate the greatness of Allah Who created them, and for why He created them, and why He created everything around them of the heavens and the earth? We have entered into major universal challenges by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, which they cannot hide just as they concealed the challenges of the test for the sake of admonition and lesson. Anyway, O people of human nations, the greatest challenge has come by Allah’s command; so who would save you from Allah’s punishment if you are truthful? If you have gods that prevent you from the universal and Corona (afflictions); signs of Allah’s chastisement, then this is the time, if you are truthful. Glory be to Allah above what they associate with Him. For so long I was eager for the guidance of the worlds to worship Allah, He Alone, no partner for Him, and to not call upon anyone with Allah. Verily the Muslims refused, except to have intercessors in front of Allah, and they claim that Allah’s messenger Mohammad is their intercessor in front of Allah! Glory be to Allah, above what they associate, the Exalted Most High beyond measures. As for the majority of the worlds, they follow the atheists deniers of Allah who are possessors of nature’s wrath. Allah’s wrath is upon them and He has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, except whoever repents and turns to his Lord to guide his heart, he will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. So how can they believe in the wrath of nature while marginalizing Allah’s wrath upon them according to their belief?! They do not care about Allah’s wrath, and they do what displease Allah, and they put Allah behind their backs, as if Allah, Who created them and the heavens and the earth, and Who controls the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, does not exist in the belief of those who behold nature’s wrath, without paying at all any attention to Allah Lord of the worlds! Yet they are the little ones in the sight of Allah. Glory be to Allah the Great, Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. So what is the matter with you that you do not hope for Allah’s reverence?  As for the Christians, they exaggerated about the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary - servant of Allah and His Messenger - and they said: “Son of God,” just as the Jews previously exaggerated intentionally, and said: “Ozair is son of God,” and others of those upon whom wrath is brought down, they said: “Allah is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary.”! Glory be to Allah, the Exalted Most High, beyond measures, the One (there is nothing before Him), the Self-Subsistent on Whom all depend (there is no one more powerful than Allah), He did not beget, nor was He begotten, and there is no one equal to Him, so who is the one who will protect you from Allah’s chastisement if you are truthful? Those who hold the doctrine of nature’s wrath, they would never benefit you, for they could not be able to help you, nor they are able to help themselves. Surely, Allah has become angry for Himself and for His purpose, and you will know that Allah attains His purpose, so you would never find for yourselves helpers other than Allah. I was so keen to guide the misguided among the worlds who followed those upon whom wrath is brought down. How much I sought to guide all those who went astray, but they were not guided due to lack of use of (their) mind. And according to the fatwa from Allah about those who do not use their minds to understand the word of Allah in the grand Quran that it is the truth from their Lord, they would never understand it except with the language of chastisement from Allah, Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, and Lord of the enormous Throne. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: [Al-Esrã`a] 17:58-59 {وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا ‎﴿٥٨﴾وَمَا مَنَعَنَا أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ النَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۚ وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا تَخْوِيفًا ‎﴿٥٩﴾‏} صدق الله العظيم [سورة الإسراء]. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni Cause of the climate heat; the Truth rises above all and not surpassed.. 09 - Rabi Awwal - 1445 AH Sep - 24 - 2023 AD 07:02 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns)  https://nasser-alyamani.org/showthread.php?p=428706  #In_the_name_of_Allah_the_One_the_Subduer.. #Urgent_to_every_human_and_each_who_has_intellect #Significant_event_an_admonishment_to_each_sane #Shanghai_Virus_Is_Torment     #TheWarningMoonIsOver #Omicron_is_a_global_calamity #Divine_Cosmic_n_Covidious_War #NoFlee_COVID_Of_DeathArrived ‎#WarningTo_Mohamed_Bin_Salman  _____________"

Liverpool should play the ball like professionals. The tackle on Bisoumma could have put his playtime for the rest of the season at stake. Liverpool was ruthless and wanted to intimidate our players with their bad tackles. Did anyone see the handball from Virgil which was overlooked by the referee.  If you feel cheated , go and have a recap and you will understand Liverpool’s plan just failed at the last minute. Congratulations COYS."
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Steve Jones yep heard that too. I would rather 60 mins then trying 90 and him making it worse and being out.  Do you think it was right starting him or having him come on at the half hour mark and finishing the game

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Spurs were actually ahead before any of the craziness. Even if Diaz's goal had stood and without the red cards I think we would have done well. The main issue we have is that our wide players don't get in behind defenders enough to break teams down. They all cut inside. Fix that and we will be laughing
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Spurs won the 2 Red cards were red cards definitely if Liverpool players play dirty or dangerously there fault the goal that was not given terrible var error should of stood but had it still no saying Spurs wouldn't of won because it would of been a different game from early in the match so Spurs won oh and if they want to help Spurs out again Liverpools fault but thank you they will accept your hand out the same as Liverpool have on numerous occasions

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Ange is always underrated as a coach. But having followed his career in Aussie, Japan & Scotland I can tell you Spurs fans are in for a great ride. He's just getting started with a team in transition and already the vibe and culture is building nicely. By the time they meet Liverpool again it will have improved a great deal more and the players will be fully invested for Ange, the fans and each other. You can see the egos being put to one side for the sake of the team, it's delivering entertaining attacking football and its only going to get better from here. Watch Ange postmatch the guy knows his business and has no illusions about how hard a road this is but he's a bloke that players will run over broken glass for. Its going to be a great season.  Sure Liverpool ate a shit sandwich this time, but every team gets to eat one now and then, that's the game, it's how you respond that matters. I'm sure that they will shake it off and roll on. Crying about it won't change it. Suck it up and carry on."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"🔴♦️Announcing the continuation of Saqar’s summer; a warning to humans♦️🔴 #quote✒2️⃣✒️  In fact I am khalifa of Allah; the national international Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, I announce to the worlds that the intense summer of Saqar; the most grievous and more bitter will sweep through the coming winter, thus destroying winter in the (Arctic) circle of the north pole, the dwelling of the worlds, for the fact the worlds are impatiently awaiting the coming winter with extreme patience, and for that I announce to the worlds from what my Lord has taught me, that you will find, starting from (December 21) of this year, 2023 AD, that the winter season is much hotter, because those who do not reason will not take a lesson from the heat of the autumn season when they find that the autumn is hottest than the ended summer. The entire planet earth with its both poles (the southern pole (Antarctic) circle, the northern pole (Arctic) circle, and the Middle East) has entered the summer of Saqar.  So when will you understand the news that you truly entered the direct summer of Saqar so you would say: Allah spoke the truth Also His khalifa, the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni? How much they exceeded with the warnings, yet the exclusive argument is Allah’s only for those who want to remember or fear, but unfortunately, signs and warnings are of no use to a people who are not certain that Allah is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and earth, because of their belief in the theories of atheists about Lord of the worlds by naming Allah’s punishment “natural disasters”, Allah has sealed their hearts, so they would not believe until they see the painful chastisement, and we say: What will you do when you find that the autumn is hotter than the summer months? But unfortunately, the signs and warnings do not avail for people who do not believe that Allah is in control of the kingdom of earth and heavens. O people of the climate summit against the disaster of Allah’s climate war, as if they are capable of changing the climate of planet earth! Rather, they allow climate change summits to be held in countries of the Muslims even though it violates the faith of Muslims! Have Muslims become atheists (denying) Allah’s existence, like the countries of the east and west, O people of the Middle East?! The atheists in the East, the West, and the Middle East will surely know who is in control of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Is Allah in control, or are they in control?! Glory be to Allah, the Great, Who controls the kingdom of heavens and earth while they are humiliated disgracefully.  In any case, from now on, I announce the escalation in the matter of the autumn heat sign, by Allah’s command. You will find the autumn heat more intense than the summer heat for whoever desires to remember, and it will not cause remembrance to the worlds except upon whom my Lord have mercy, and none will remember except possessors of understanding-minds. As well, we announce from now on, by Allah’s command, the over-spread extreme heat of Saqar for the upcoming winter. Saqar, by the command of Allah the One, the Subduer, Will surely raise the level of raging and roaring heat towards the planet earth from the south, southeast, and southwest, in order to raise Allah’s climate war disaster against the people of planet earth, by Allah’s command, on various types of Allah’s climate war disaster, on land and at sea. And as well with Allah’s command, the intense war escalation of Covid (Mateen) [firm plot from Allah] after the death of Xi Jinping, the President of China, and Allah’s command is preordained decree in the written Book. Let the criminals beware who want to extinguish Allah’s light in the East, West, and the Middle East. Verily, I swear by the Compeller of the heavens and earth, my Lord and your Lord Allah, the One and Subbuer, indeed Allah perfects His light, willingly or unwillingly, even if the criminals hate His prevail..

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,The whole Tottenham team look like a group of bored teenagers feeling irrelevant to this battle between cheating officials and a brave and gallant Liverpool team. Tottenham were the biggest losers of the night.
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Lol. You guys won't end up in top 4 I bet you. Rubbish team. You wouldn't have even beaten a 10-man Liverpool team. You'll play them again at Anfield. Just wait

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Craig Douthwaite was it Tottenham’s fault they made a mistake?
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Nice having 5 extra players
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Make the most of your high flying Spurs because you do it every season but as we all know it never lasts so enjoy while it does,5th or 6th after Christmas"
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Bobby Mottram  It wasn’t but you seem to be ok with it from your comments but if you’re happy winning a game in that manner that’s absolutely fine,personally I’d rather win fairly & with style not controversy"
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Kev Manton
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,You win because of bad and shameful decisions. ... we got nothing against spurs but the officials
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Craig Douthwaite it was controversial don’t get me wrong but would be more so if it was a last minute winner it happened early on and both teams were still at 11 so the game was still there for anyone,I think the reds were fair In my opinion I understand jota’s first yellow he didn’t touch the player but from watching the game I think it was a build up of fouls why the ref gave him a yellow then his own doings to foul again a couple of minutes later to get the second. Do I think the game should be played again no as spurs weren’t at fault and at this current moment nothing is riding on those points but I completely understand Liverpool fans being annoyed just don’t like the idea of spurs being some how to blame"
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Best 9 men with. 12  Celebrated like won something empty trophy cabinet
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Jon stop trolling. Was it Spurs fault any of the decisions? Should celebrate when you win, you never know when there’s no tomorrow. Jota scored against Spurs last season when he should have been off but I didn’t moan about that."
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Shame
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"Julian Horsley Maybe they should review the VAR decision in the CL Final in 2019 when Liverpool got the penalty in the first 2 minutes 🤔 Not sure what Liverpool want out of all this, because the game will sure as hell not be replayed. The officials should be punished, not the team 🙄"
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Sarah What so many people seem to be failing to grasp is it wasn’t a technology fail. The VAR is a human being the same human beings that make wrong decisions and mistakes all the time. The game before and after VAR has a history of mistakes. Yes this was a wrong decision 100%. An inexcusable decision. But don’t start questioning the referees integrity or suggesting some sort of conspiracy. It’s actually a fact that Liverpool gained the 2nd most points from VAR decisions last year. So to suggest there’s any anti-Liverpool agenda is ludicrous.
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,Thet Oo Maung they can't think of setting their feet on Anfield 😤😤😡
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool September 30,"The mighty spurs..... a total joke.... well this post is. If you think that victory is worth celebrating, then give yourselves a good shake.

PID are commonly used in industrial automation for many reasons. 1- PID controllers provide quicker response time. 2- PID controllers do not create swings unlike on/off controllers. 3- PID controllers are more accurate and precise. 4- PID controllers are considered process independent. 5- PID controllers are stable in performance.   https://youtu.be/VNOVk0xTXOw

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,#LeviOUT
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Tottenham Hotspur put in a strong fight in the second half. The damage was done in the first 15 minutes of the first half. So many positives to take from the game.
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,So bad
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Once again, a fightback for fifth place. 10 games ago, getting a 3-3 draw at Anfield would've been a decent result, maybe positives to take out of the team's performance at 4-3 - but this is the point of the season where it's about results. Fighting for fifth is nowhere near good enough. Man United and Newcastle both won earlier, so a win would've kept top four as BARELY possible, solely due to the mathematical aspect. We would've been six points behind Man United, who have two games in hand. Nigh on impossible with such little left of this season.  Individual players can walk off the pitch with their heads held high. Harry Kane, 25th league goal of the season, and he matches Wayne Rooney's overall record. Sonny with another goal, and in a poor season, he's still reached double-digits. And I'm happy for Richarlison, who has his first goal in the Premier League for us. But the season is still failure. The only silver lining for me is that we're one step closer to getting a season to reset without European football. We're now in sixth, level with Aston Villa. Brighton have three games in hand, and we still have to go to Villa Park, so eighth place is a realistic outcome, and for me, that's not the worst place to be in. It will still hurt - I wanted to win the Champions League at Wembley next season - but in the long-term, maybe it's better for us to get out of Europe.  One thing I did notice, though - if we were trying to get back into the game, then why did it take Ryan Mason until the 84th minute to make his second substitution? Is there a hidden rule that you're only allowed one sub before the final 15 minutes or so? It makes no sense."
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,I wouldn't blame Moura for the defeat - our passive play in the first 15 minutes already gave us a mountain too high to climb. Yes we need to sort out our rubbish defence but that comeback is the spirit we want to see.

But it wasn't until the over the 60th minute that we got 2 Goals back. There was one by Son. But it took him Third Time Lucky to do so as he hit the Lampost Twice. But it was a shame that we lost against Liverpool 4-3 in the end. However. The pleasing fact Today that Harry Kane scored 208 Goals with Sir Wayne Rooney.

Aye there are issues in your team but there are issues in most teams, it’s about belief. You need owners that believe, back room staff that believe and players who believe. Spurs will bounce back I’m sure."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Defender positions available, send resume"
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"2nd mistake by Lucas Moura since he returned from his period of injury. Just shows what happens when you utilize even an experienced player who has no rhythm in his game time. If in doubt, clear it out not play a back pass!! He lost us a valuable point and threw away a remarkable comeback. Again, our defense not switched on at the beginning of a game (Porro and Dier). Simple schoolboy errors, not tracking or engaging your runners. What's wrong is management want to give Dier a 3-year contract. What a mistake. I'll accept it if he's only a backup CB, but not a key player as we rebuild from the back. Obviously, it would be difficult to bring in 2 top class defenders in one season unless we pay big money. Our defense gives our forwards a mountain to climb every game. We keep leaking goals, so we need to maybe start as a straight back 4 because the 3 switching to a 5 is not working when you have both wingers who are simply passable defenders."

Slice through Hojbjerg in midfield like hot butter on a knife and Dier wouldn't make my U18 schoolboy side. Kept finding red jerseys throughout the game. As a diehard Spurs fan I'm obliged to say let's build on that second half, but again I said it twice before and Spurs have now shipped 12 goals in three games. Therein lies a story. 🤬😢"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"obviously this is a loss, but coming back from a 6-1 defeat, a draw against United, going 3-0 down in the first half, the boys started looking like a premier league club again after so long… I do have to admit, I was wrong about Lucas Moura and perhaps he is a shadow of his past self and I was backing him even after the red card that got him the suspension. Either way, Jota should have gotten a red card because that was a high and dangerous kick."
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,That was cruel . the fact we came back from 3-0 down and still lost very very cruel
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Lucas Moura why????🤔🤔🤔🤔
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Oh Lucas... I went out to celebrate outside and when I come back, I see my brother celebrating...

I'm a Sonny fan but even though Moura made a mistake and we lost, these dual fans' hearts towards the players are really upsetting.  Are you guys real fans? No matter how important victory is, there is no victory without the players.  Please don't blame the players for their poor performance because they lost and made mistakes, but have a heart of encouragement and support. I'm angry,  Tottenham fans are because of the duality😡"

So there is still a problem of ridiculous decision always being made by Levy. Such as spending more than 30 mil on Sanchez? Not a good decision made as well. Also he is not spending money on positions we need.  Everytime we have a new manager our players do play better. But I am sure after a few matches they are going to be themselves again. Pretty obvious as this has happened every time for the last manager's like Mourinho, Nuno and Conte"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Dissapointment yet again, all too often at present. Yes scored three goals, but not good enough when you concede 4, and to get to what looked like unlikely draw to conced again a minute later, well what can you say! What's worrying is that Levy and rest of the heirarchy are just going to say ""ah we were so unlucky, blah blah, and say the way we got back into game is a positive. Sorry but the whole situation just isn't good enough, and us fans are getting sick of our club being in the others shadows. You can't keep  conceding three goals, starting games and playing first half so shockingly poorly, and expect to win games. You shouldn't have to be hoping to play better in second half and having to score 4 or 5 goals to win games. The whole situation is desperate and somethings got to be done."
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Horace Lee is it levy though?? 100% Richarlison isn’t worth that much, but if a GOOD manager turns to levy and says “I don’t want him” would levy shell out £60mil? No he wouldn’t because he is a smart businessman. The manager ultimately decides who he plays and wants in his team. Sanchez (on paper) at the time was worth it, but wasn’t cut out for the prem, just like Jansen, soldado, pav, lo celso, ndombele, Vinicius etc some work out, some don’t, players come with reputations and some live up to the hype and some don’t, the manager should know what they do and don’t need and I truely believe that if any manager turned to levy and said that they don’t want them particular players, he wouldn’t buy them. Like you I just want the best for spurs, but the truth is that if you have a squad of 11 players paid thousands to play and a manager paid equally well, it is down to those individuals to make it happen, all levy needs to do is open his wallet! So why is it levy’s fault that his multi million signings aren’t performing?? It isn’t, every player signed has a reputation and is worth their fee but it is down to the player to be worth that price tag, deli Ali springs to mind here, great player, until he thought he was too good, now look at him, is that levy’s fault too??"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Andy Ferne I am pretty sure each manager would have told Levy they need better defenders. Even us fans knows we need defender much more urgently than a striker. Probably if Levy has spent that 60mil on another player(which he RARELY does), then we might be in a different position now.  Also, the percentage of players who we got and doesn't live up to expectations are much higher than other teams like man city and Liverpool. You are able to list out quite a few names already, not counting others as well. Let's take a step back and say it's not Levy but the scouting team/board members who advices which player to buy. Well then they are not up to the job as well. However if Levy's still here and listen to their unreliable advice than this problem is still going to go on. And if Levy's not leaving I don't think we will have a chance of reconstructing the whole director board. (Not sure if they've got any close relationship with Levy). As I said, the players might seem like the most obvious problem, but the root of the problem is still the poor management of the board."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Spurs were poor. Non-existent midfield. Without proper service Kane and Sonn have no impact. Good character shown to come back back 3 down, but we should not have been in that position after 20 mins. Liverpool should have killed the game off  but allowed us back in. We need a manager to direct the team, and players who want to play for the club. We didn't deserve to win the game, but neither did Liverpool.  A far cry from a top 4 performance."

You can forgive mistakes once every 10 games or so, but the lad does something every week. He makes our whole defence look terrible. We need a solid CB in the summer and he needs to go!  Was great seeing us battle back, but you can’t expect to concede before we start to play and look like we have a game plan.   Credit to our fans who sang and supported all the way through. They created a great atmosphere from the away end."

Forget the overall game which we eventually made a match of, these players train together every day and then come out onto the pitch, game after game, and for 15-20 minutes perform like strangers who have never met.  After the Newcastle humiliation, we were promised ""This must never happen again"".   Against Liverpool, it took all of 14 minutes to bust that promise wide open.  Has there ever been a collection of footballers so unprofessional, dozy and brainless who still can't manage a game.  I have seen a lot of ""Brainless"" footballers but Romero must be at the top of the list.  Ridiculous challenges that lead to Yellow, Red Cards and Penalties early in just about every game.  When I played Sunday morning football, if I had done what Moura did, I would have been scared to go into our own changing room after the game."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Last time after the New U. game I spoke about Dier and I'll do it again. He is our boss in the defence with a CB position. He is responsible as a last man standing. The first goal with the cross he is way to high. At the place where he is standing there are already 5 spurs players against 3 attackers. If he drops back more towards the goal, Romero can make a step back, as well as Porro. Of course Porro is not looking whats behind him, but Dier is doing nothing.  At the second goal he lost sight of Gakpo who can cross the ball back. The way he is running after him is very poor.  And then the penalty moment, of course the charge was from Romero, but if you look back at it. Youll see that Dier was defending Gakpo, but out of the blue he stepped in to cover a ball to Salah, but the ball passed him and Gakpo could receive it on the free roam. If he hold position, then Romero didnt had to defend Gakpo over there.  Again: he has a key position, but he makes strange decisions and I analysed it against NewU as well as today. And this season I saw almost every goal we conceded and a lot of times I'm asking myself, wth is he doing there?!"

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Spurs record in Anfield is brutal…probably deserved a draw today but with such a poor start - with amateur-hour defending and goalkeeping - maybe not. Good effort though after going 3-0 down.

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,Stefan Enzo Selvaggi what defence?
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,What pundits picked out was Mason pulled Deki into midfield at 3-0 down to make it 3-5-2 formation. Always thought we have struggled with 2 in midfield. It is also always difficult to win games if you have not got a good defence. They haven't prioritised a quality CB signing. We have qualty attackers that can win games as shown today.Just the simple things tottenham not getting right.
Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,You grim lot! That was an excellent game. We got overwhelmed at first then we dominated them in the second half. Many chances. Bad luck. COYS!!!

You should never pass like that backwards, only forwards. He still is a good player, but something isn't working, and maybe that's the leadership problem we've had. The leaders we've had lately have kicked him whilst he's been down. I hope he can bounce back. I'd prefer it to be sooner rather than later though."

Facebook,Tottenham vs. Liverpool May 1,"Ryan Mason is a good caretaker manager, winning more than he loses (just), but how Spursy is he?  Having 2 comeback performances in the last 2 games from 2-0 down and 3-0 down.  I think Ryan Mason will make a great Spurs head coach one day, but not yet.  Mourinho and Conte were both proven winners, but in the long term neither could manage out the Spurs mentality.  Over the summer they need to get a proven winner that can train out the Spursy nature of this side.  I honestly think the best man for the job may be a women - they should bring in Sarina Wiegman in the summer."
