If I, as a viewer am this frustrated, I can only imagine Cuti's frustration.   He has been criticized for this and that, but there were times when he was forced to play extra aggressively and draw a card. It was either that or letting his opponents score and win the game. Only Sonny seemed to have perceive Cuti's heart and intentions and Cuti being surprised by Sonny's perceptiveness. The man is willing to draw a card, at the risk of being tossed out or tossed out, sacrificing himself for the team and yet fans and anti-fans complain Cuti is playing too aggressively. This man was never a lamb, HE WAS AND IS A LION. Isn't this why Tottenham recruited him?  Nothing worse than when you're trying to do the best and fans misunderstand the player's intentions and blame him for things that are beyond his control. Cuti is a great player and he can play for any club. The fans should give him more respect & appreciation before this man decides to pack up and leave too.

But after Conte, just look at how Perisic, Sonny, and Kane (always the best) are doing. It's just so much better. The problem we have left is the midfielders and defenders. Eric Dier, anyone could tell he was horrible. Porro has advantages in attacking, but isn't the best for a full-back; he sometimes makes stupid mistakes and is too eager to score a goal as a defender. Skipp, IDK what this guy is doing not a good passer, not a good dribbler, not a good defensive midfielder, he's just running around like fool. Lastly some concerns about Kane too. He's all good but this kind of play style really limits Kane's ability to finish. We do not have good playmakers like Messi or KDB (just as an example). Even Son is more like a finisher/scorer rather than a traditional winger. This really limits Kane to sit at the half-line like Central Attacking Midfielder and give good passes to the wingers for a finish. We really need players like Eriksen (who left the club). We saw Kane and Son as a two top for a while in this  game and I can tell that it works better than three top formation. Our three top formation can't move the ball forwards to the attackers so well.",11,5

It's right to give up Dier because they can't give up Kane and Sonny. In order to persuade Kane, Levy will have to choose a good manager, but Kane will be able to challenge again only when he is promised to release the recruitment funds to completely replace the current defense. This defense can never convince Kane. Tactically, there is also a limit to covering the players' weaknesses. Now they have to spend a lot of money on a proven defender.

(다이어 같은 센터백들은 원래 수비실력이 않좋았던것도 있지만)  수비수들은 무엇보다 가장 합리적이고 더 나은 판단을 빨리 내리는게 중요합니다. 즉 예를들어 내가 저쪽애를 마크하러 가는게 낫겠구나 그러면 이쪽상대를 내옆 동료가 마크하는게 나을거니까 라는식의 판단을 빨리 하고 실행을 하죠. 그런데...기존의 일반적인 수비방식이 아닌....우리팀에 수비수중에 수비력이 안돼는 수비수가 2명이 생기면서 그 윙백 2명이 각자 마크해야할 상대선수까지 여차하면 도와줘야하는데...다른정상적인 팀이라면 이런일은 벌어지지 않는거죠.. 우리팀만 현재 윙백이 있는데 그 윙백은 수비력이 0에 가까우니까요. 그래서 그 윙백이 혹시 뚫리면 도와주러 가는 경우까지 생각해야하게 되죠. 그래서 판단을 하는데 있어서 더 복잡해지고 그래서 생각하는데 시간이 더 걸리기도 하고 잘못된 판단을 하게되기도 할껍니다.  또는 코치진이 그렇게 오더를 하진 않았을지라도 센터백들이 윙백들의 수비실력을 믿지 못하게 되서 결국 그런 경우까지 대비하고 고려해서 판단을 하게 됬을지도 모릅니다.  그래서 결국엔 센터백 1명이 이런일을 계속하다보니 계속 문제가 생기고 또 다른 센터백도 이 센터백을 신뢰할수가 없게 되고 또 반복되는 문제가 생기게 되죠.  또한 이 윙백들이 수비또한 잘 하지도 않기도 하고 수비실력도 없어서 윙포워드들 또한 망가지고 있죠. 윙포워드들이 이 윙백이 공격하러 자리를 비우면 그거 백업하느라 더욱 수비쪽으로 위치하게 됩니다. 그래서 공격하러 올라가는 거리가 길어지게되고 더욱 지치게 됩니다. 그래서 공격수가 공격포인트가 별로 없게 된다고 사람들로 부터 비난을 받게되고 그로인해 공격을 하러올라갔을때 평정심을 잃고 좀더 욕심을 부리게 되어 무리한 슈팅을 나사하게 되기도 합니다.   즉 이렇게 윙백을 위한 축구를 하던 콘테 하나때문에 팀전체가 무너진거죠..  이에대한 증빙자료가 될만한 사실로는 페리시치가 영입되기 전까지는 수비조직력이 괜찮아서 전시즌 후반기때는 성적도 잘나와서 탑4에 들어 챔스도 나가게됬죠. 그런데 같은 센터백선수인데...페리시치가 영입된 이번시즌 부터는 수비조직력이 30퍼센트정도 하락했죠.  실점 상황을 보면 알수있죠. 그리고 올 겨울 포로가 영입되고나서는 수비조직력이 60퍼센트까지 더 하락하게되고 실점은 더욱 늘어나게 됩니다.  즉 수비력없는 윙백(페리시치)이 1명 생겼을땐 실점이 30퍼센트 늘었고 수비력없는 윙백(포로)이 1명 더 생기니까 실점이 60퍼센트인 2배로 더 늘었죠. 양쪽다 수비력없는 윙백이 출전해버리니까 수비조직력이 완전 막장이 되어버린거죠.  윙백은 수비는 할줄 모르는데 그렇다고 공격을 공격수보다 잘하는것도 아니고...도데체 이런 비효율적인 짓을 왜 콘테는 한겁니까.  즉 콘테는 공격이 전문인 공격수들에겐 수비를 시키고, 공격이 전문이 아닌선수들에게 공격을 시켰죠. 얼마나 비효율적이냐구요.  다음시즌엔 이런 폐단을 없애려면... 페리시치와 포로 같은 윙백은 팔아버려야합니다.  4백 시스템으로 정상적수비력을 갖춘 풀백을 영입하고 좋은감독 영입해야합니다",2,0

If we can preserve all the attackers and recruit Lee Kang-in and Kim Min-jae, we can win the league next year. You'll be excited about their skills.

They are SPINELESS literally and metaphorically. You can't build a team with Eric Dyer as your starting center back he's NOT an Alpha! Romero would be the one to lead this team (He has not be faultless either). Dyer coasts most of the game. He hates closing down, covering or winning duals! Look at the goals Spurs concede and you will see he doesn't put his body on the line for the team (half sprinting to close  space, hates blocking or wedge tackling.)

Просто грустно, что за минуту до конца вот такое вот происходит. Я просто радовалась голу Ричи, как мы уже  проиграли.
