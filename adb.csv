1,1.48,12/14/2016,sponsorship speech,Hontiveros,In Favor,,,In Favor,"In 2015, when the United Nations High Commissioner was asked to report on discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity to the Human Rights Council, the following were noted all over the world: Different states had adopted or strengthened their anti-discrimination and hate crime laws. Some had introduced legal protection for intersex persons. Others had abolished criminal sanctions for homosexuality, allowed marriage and civil unions for same-sex couples, and instituted reforms granting legal recognition of transgender persons. In other countries, programs had been established to ensure that the police, judges, prison guards, medical staff and teachers were receiving gender and sexuality training, that there were anti-bullying programs in schools, and that shelters had been built to house homeless LGBTIQ youths. These were small developments. Davids of a resistance to a Goliath of widespread and brutal, hate-motivated violence, often perpetrated with impunity and “everyday discrimination” LGBTIQ face, countless times, repeatedly, from the riots at Stone Wall in Manhattan, New York to the shooting spree at Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida, to that little shady bathroom in Celzone Lodge in Olongapo City where Jennifer Laude was found covered with injuries, head leaning against the toilet bowl, drowned to death. This is hate. Unwarranted, violent hate. An irrational prejudice against our fellow human beings founded on some petty condescending notion that they should dress like us, act like us. be like us, love like us. A deep-seated hate we refuse to acknowledge and address, the same hate we have been fighting against for 17 long years. Yes, the Anti-Discrimination Bill or what we can now call ""SOGIE Equality Bill"" is already seventeen years old. We have long been fighting for equality. Our struggle has gone on for a long time. This afternoon, I am filing before the 17th Congress the Anti-Discrimination Act of 2016, or An Act Prohibiting Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity or Expression, and Providing Penalties Therefor. This Anti-Discrimination Act aims to: • eliminate all forms of discrimination based on SOGIE; • list and define discriminatory acts committed in employment, public service and exercise of profession, in educate or learning institutions, in organizations and associations, in access to medical and health services, in establishments, facilities, utilities, and services, in forced medical or psychological evaluation, in contact with or in custody of law enforcement officers, and other forms of discrimination perpetrated in similar settings; • introduce to Philippine legislation the concept of SOGIE or Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity or Expression; • mandate the creation of social protection and diversity programs that will protect LGBTIQ’s rights and promote equality; • provide for redress mechanisms in police stations, in the workplace, and in the Commission on Human Rights (CHR); and • ensure that discrimination, stigma and hate will not hinder anyone from access to educate, healthcare, employment and other fundamental rights. Moreover, this Anti-Discrimination Act will be the compliance of the Philippine government with the obligation imposed upon states by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). It will likewise give life and uphold our very own equal protection clause in the 1987 Constitution. The principle of non-discrimination is one of the underlying thrusts of a human rights regime. It follows that protecting gays, lesbians, bisexuals transgenders, queers, and intersex from differental treatment should at least be basic state guarantee. No transwoman should be forced to have a masculine haircut in the office. No gay person should be banned from donating blood. No transgender person should be detained at Immigration. No gay or lesbian person should ne harassed or extorted by the police. No young boy who likes the color pink should be bullied in school. The lack of protective laws and supportive policies is obviously not helping. Worse, it is empowering homophobia and affording impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuse. But while other governments chose to respond, we chose to neglect. In the recent vote in the UNHRC to retain the Independent Expert on Discrimination and Violence against LGBTQ, the Philippines abstained. Citing our lack of policy against discrimination, we chose to renege on our human rights obligation. We let hate win and humanity lose. Now, this 17 years' worth of struggle is staring us in the face this afternoon. Along with our brothers and sisters in the LGBTQ community who have been living their lives treated differently, mocked, laughed at and stripped off their dignity just because they have the courage to be who they are. Just because they are brave enough to be different. Despite all this, they never lose hope. To allies who never got tired, never surrendered, to those who hoped that the Anti-Discrimination Bill will reach the Senate plenary this afternoon thank you very much. Our long fight against discrimination is fueled by your uncompromising, unyielding, and inspiring belief that a world that is equal and kind is possible. And that somehow, at some point, we will get there. The protection of the dignity of every human person must, without reservations, form part of our national policy. This Anti- Discrimination Act will be our commitment to the fundamental equality of all persons before the law, a fulfillment of our long and overdue promise - human rights for all."
130,1.48,12/14/2016,manifestation,Legarda,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"associated herself with all the views propounded by Senator Hontiveros. she filed a similar bill in 2007 that included prohibiting discrimination on the basis of not just gender identity and sexual orientation but also indigenous peoples and others, and which was referred to the Committee on Cultural Communities, the Anti- Ethnic, Racial, religion and Sexual Discrimination and Profiling Act. would Senator Hontiveros agree to expand the coverage ofSenate Bill No. 1271 at the proper time; however, if Senator Hontiveros believes that it would be easier to pass a bill focused solely on prohibiting discrimination against sexual orientation, she would go along with it. the country has not adopted yet a clear policy on how to treat those who are different, and she underscored the importance of regarding each human being as such, not on the basis ofone’s sexual orientation. She added that every human being deserves every basic human right that one is entitled to. she would coordinate with the Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality and the Secretariat on how to go about with her proposal."
155,1.48,12/14/2016,reply to manifestation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Legarda,In Favor,In Favor,"thanked Senator Legarda for her support and said that she would look forward to the progress of the comprehensive Anti-Discriminatory Bill. in putting together the whole policy framework, there can be companion measures."
162,1.48,12/14/2016,manifestation,Gordon,Silent,Legarda,In Favor,Silent,Adverting to Senator Hontiveros’ statement suggesting that gays and lesbians are prohibited from donating blood. the Red Cross does not discriminate as they only screen with regard to AIDS or health condition.
167,1.48,12/14/2016,reply to manifestation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Gordon,Silent,Silent,"she would furnish Senator Gordon with specific information ofcertain blood centers that have contrary policy to that of the Red Cross, review the data, as those might not be Red Cross blood centers"
173,1.48,12/14/2016,manifestation,Gordon,Silent,Hontiveros,In Favor,Silent,"there are only two entities in the country that can screen, provide and collect blood: the government, through DOH and their hospitals, and private hospital, that are authorized to do so he is against this policy of allowing two entities as he would rather have centralized blood collections. the Red Cross is the longest blood-providing agency in the whole country, and he noted that when Senator Hontiveros mentioned “blood centers,” they could only be either a government hospital or a private hospital."
186,1.48,12/14/2016,reply to manifestation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Gordon,Silent,Silent,"she was also looking forward to the bill that Senator Gordon filed, seeking to set up and modernize the blood bank system in the Philippines which would be enriched by the long and rich history of the Philippine National Red Cross."
191,1.48,12/14/2016,manifestation,Poe,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"she had also filed a similar, yet more comprehensive, anti-discrimination bill which was referred also to the Committee on Cultural Communities. She hoped that the bill could also be referred to the Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality."
197,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"commended Senator Hontiveros for coming up with the proposed measure, saying that it will be an important legislation if enacted into law because it would expressly recognize the right of individuals of diverse sexual orientation or gender identity or expression to legal equality as a fundamental right beginning with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. the bill would provide legislative clarity to the rights of individuals with diverse sexual orientation or LGBT as highlighted in the case Ang Ladlad LGBT Party vs. Comelec."
209,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,thanked Senator De Lima for expressing her support for the bill.
211,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"according to the Philippine LGBT Hate Crime Watch, there have been 164 cases of murdered LGBT in the country from 1996 to 2012. she is aware that adults and children experience harassment or bullying, a phenomenon recognized by the Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP),"
218,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"based on the 2014 Philippines Country Report “On Being LGBT in Asia,” 28 LGBT Filipinos were murdered in 2011 because of their sexual identities. Hate crimes are among the worst forms of discrimination against people of diverse sexual orientation or gender identity that even the phenomena of harassment/ bullying in schools and workplaces likewise constitutes a form of discrimination."
228,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"Statement of the PAP published in the Philippine Journal of Psychology in 2011, “Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Filipinos continue to experience stigma, prejudice and discrimination in Philippine society. This stigma is manifested in actions such as bullying, teasing and harassment of LGBT children and adolescents in families, schools and communities.” Notwithstanding the fact that Republic Act No. 10627, or the “Anti-Bullying Act of 2013” addresses the issue of bullying in elementary and secondary schools, the phenomenon of bullying in the society should produce a bigger picture of laws against many forms of discrimination. Senator Hontiveros as a human rights advocate has taken a strong consideration to the lifelong impact of discrimination not only against the LGBT as direct victims but also their families and loved ones."
248,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"discrimination against people of diverse sexual orientation or gender identity or expression begins at the early stage of childhood life and leaves a lasting trauma to the young person and his/her family. To cite an instance in the educate sector, Hender Gercio, a transgender student from UP Diliman who protested against her French language professor for refusing to address her as a female because the latter said that it is against her religion beliefs; and the case of the first transgender chairperson of the UP Diliman Student Council, Gabriel Paolo “Heart” Difio, who was asked to sign a “gentleman’s policy” in a private school which was a contract that prohibits gay students from screaming or putting on make-up. in any stage, the life cycle of an individual of diverse sexual orientation or gender identity or expression is richly documented in terms of economic cost of homophobia. On whether or not an amendment to the title of the bill would be considered to reflect the LGBT as its direct right holders. she is open in amending the title especially if the new title would explicitly identify the right holders which would not only be limited to LGBT but also include individuals of diverse sexual orientation or gender identities or expressions in the country."
276,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,desire to see the list of actual incidents of discriminations so it would be more imperative to further legislate provisions for the protection of individuals with diverse sexual orientations.
280,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"she would submit the comprehensive documentation of gender equality advocates in the Philippines, the most traumatic of which was the case of Jennifer Laude and cases of refusal of entry to establishments involving television personalities - Inday Garutay and BB Gandanghari. Regarding cases of discrimination in employment, mainly in some recruitment processes, transwomen were told to cut their hair short and dress in men’s clothes to get the Job they are applying for."
291,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,On the issue of cross dress or the circumstance whereby a person who was bom physically male prefers to be addressed as a “she” and wears lady’s apparel if prohibitions against cross dress falls within the contemplation of prohibited acts under the proposed measure.
298,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"in principle, prohibitions on cross dress falls under the prohibited acts under the definition of terms in the bill, “gender identity” refers to the personal sense of identity as characterized, among others, by manner of clothing, inclinations, and behavior in relations to masculine or feminine conventions; in addition, “gender expression,” another key concept which the bill seeks to enshrine in Philippine law, refers to the outward manifestations of the cultural traits that enable a person to identify as male or female according to patterns, that at a particular moment in history, a given society define as gender appropriate. This  may embrace the manner of clothing and would relate to the issue of wearing school uniforms. the school is one of the institutions which challenges the equal value and dignity of every person and where Senate Bill No. 1271, as a human rights legislation that addresses the historical prejudice against LGBT-IQs, must step up to eliminate discrimination. Emphasizing that it is time to remove gender insensitive rules which has contributed to the systematic homophobia, transphobia and stigma, she said that if a rule or policy in an educate institution or workplace would devalue the dignity of another human being, it should be declared discriminatory and should be proscribed. schools should be reminded that the wearing of uniforms to identify schools and other institutions as well as uniforms worn by persons in authority are not supposed to be imposed to promote gender binaries; instead, rules and policies on uniforms should be challenged to become SOGIE-sensitive."
334,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"On school uniforms, there are some schools and universities like FEU that allow students to cross dress although she is uncertain if it is an exception insofar as the level of tolerance on the issue of cross dress in educate institutions is concerned. she was glad to learn from the Sponsor that the bill would contemplate violates on the part of schools and universities if they impose express prohibition against cross dress she would propose a clearer provision on prohibited acts relative to cross dress."
347,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"appreciated the suggestion and thanked Senator De Lima for mentioning FEU as an example of an institution which promote non-discrimination and diversity, saying that all government agencies, GOCCs, private companies, private and public educate institutions and other entities should establish diversity programs to ensure that human rights violates and violence on the basis of SOGIE are prevented."
356,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,Legarda,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"her wholehearted support to the measure, saying that through the bill, the Philippines could be at the forefront of protecting the rights of individuals with diverse sexual orientation. these rights should include individuals with diverse sexual orientation in the media because sometimes they are mocked in television programs, radio, print and online. this discrimination in print, broadcast and online media was included in a bill that she had previously sponsored but which was limited to discrimination against ethnicity and had been amended by the late Senator Defensor Santiago to include discrimination against gender identity."
371,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Legarda,In Favor,In Favor,looked forward to discussing with Senator Legarda on how the SOGIE bill and a more comprehensive measure addressing various types of discrimination could be passed separately so that they could complement each other in a package of anti-discrimination measures.
378,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,Legarda,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"it was important to ensure that gender identity discrimination is eliminated in speech, actions and policies government institutions and the private sector to have an open mind and respect the gender identity or expressions of others."
384,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Legarda,In Favor,In Favor,expressed her appreciation for Senator Legarda’s affirmation on the need to pass the two anti-discrimination bills separately as well on the concern raised on Section 5 (a) which states that “it shall be unlawful to promote stigma in media” and believed that her colleague would have many rich insights and contributions to further improve the measure.
392,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"the importance of having sufficient and effective redress mechanisms for violates of the provisions of the measure. Having been a former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), while Republic Act No. 9710 (Magna Carta of Women) encompasses all human rights of women, there are instances when men with diverse sexual orientation are without clear recourse or direction in the application for reliefs when there are breaches of their rights as members of sexual minorities. whether the bill would ensure that men with diverse SOGIE can access the CHR in its capacity as gender ombudsman in investigating such violates until such time that the commission would have its own charter that would include the protection of these parties."
410,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"the bill intends to provide redress mechanisms for SOGIE-related cases for men which is also consistent with Senator Legarda’s proposed amendment to explicitly identify the rights holders which would include men of diverse SOGIE. the inclusion of SOGIE concerns could be implemented by expanding the PNP women and children’s desks to cover all individuals of whatever sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression who might seek redress of their grievances in the spirit of what is promised by the Gender and Development (GAD) Act."
422,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,the CHR could develop a database on breaches of human rights of LGBT amid reported cases of murder and physical violence of such individuals
426,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,willingness to receive suggestions on how to further expand the formulation of paragraph 3 of Section 9 (d) (Role of the Commission on Human Rights) w'hich mandates the CHR to “document cases of discrimination on the basis of SOGIE and shall include these documented cases in its annual human rights report” so that this information would be part of the continuing database of the commission
435,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,if the measure would consider tapping the GAD budget for its programs.
437,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,". Section 11 contemplates the creation of a congressional oversight committee to be called the Anti- Discrimination Oversight Committee which, within three years after the enactment of this Act, will conduct an audit of national and local policies that discriminate on the basis of SOGIE. part of the audit could be on how well the GAD budget has been spent to promote gender sensitivity, gender equality and eliminate discrimination. this oversight committee would cease to exist six years after its organization since it is expected that during such period, the best practices in terms of spending the GAD budget would have been identified and the spirit and the letter of the law would have been internalized and institutionalized in various public and private institutions in society."
455,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,how the committee would address possible objections to the bill on the basis of religion
457,1.58,2/6/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,De Lima,In Favor,In Favor,"human rights protection does not negate the exercise of religion freedom Catholic Bishops of the Philippines (CBCP) President Archbishop Socrates Villegas himself had said that passing an anti-discrimination law would be a gesture of charity or love. statement that the Archbishop issued on March 3, 2015 which urged priests to care for all, including the LGBT community. Archbishop Villegas not only warned parents against imbuing children with hate against LGBT but even instructed Catholic schools to implement a zero tolerance policy against bullying. such statement presages some of the measures contemplated by the bill in terms of programs to promote non-discrimination and diversity. statements from the CBCP which demonstrate that the bill did not contradict but is consistent with what is being preached by the Roman Catholic Church such as its belief that discrimination “does not conform to Pope Francis’ vision of the Church as the sacrament of Divine mercy and compassion.” the CBCP also underscored the pontiffs belief that discrimination is contrary to the gospel spirit because verbal and physical violence against LGBT is an offense against God."
485,1.58,2/6/2017,interpellation,De Lima,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"the measure would not* meet many objections from the Catholic Church, particularly as Pope Francis himself has given assurance that transsexuals and homosexuals are being accepted and embraced by the Catholic church the bill should address objections by other sects who might not have the same level of tolerance because of concerns that it would be encroaching on the freedom of religion"
494,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"he supports the measure to remove discrimination, there remain some issues that he would want clarified. if Senate Bill No. 1271 intends to amend any existing law"
499,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,the bill seeks to provide by force of law the guarantees against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression that are promised to every citizen of the country through the Constitution and in various human rights instruments.
506,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"Regarding the definition of discrimination as stated in paragraph (a) of Section 3 clarified as regards the following proviso: “For purposes of this provision, the actual sex, sexual orientation or gender identity of the person subjected to discrimination shall not be relevant for the purpose of determining whether an act of discrimination has been committed.”"
514,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"gender identity would not be relevant in determining whether an act of discrimination has been committed. She said that the provision would be clarified by the proposal raised in the earlier interpellation of Senator De Lima as regards the rewording of the title of the bill to eventually refer not to the act of discrimination but to the rights of every individual, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. appreciation to Senator De Lima for understanding the intent of the bill which is not only to protect discrimination of the LGBT but to uphold the rights against discrimination or the freedom from discrimination of every individual, including straights Section 3(a) means that the actual SOGIE of the person discriminated against shall not be relevant for determining whether an act of discrimination has been committed and that the focus would be on the discrimination itself and not in the actual identity or orientation of the victim"
534,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,As regards Section 5 reason for the need of a family court or a court’s approval for minors to undertake medical or psychological examination to determine or alter the person’s SOGIE why the determination could not be asked of the minor’s parents or legal guardian
542,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"the family court would still request the parents or the legal guardians to weigh in as they are the persons in whose authority the minor is placed. there are some cases where parents force their kids to undergo such an examination, thus the family court would have to request the parents or the legal guardian to weigh in to provide some kind of guidance"
550,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,where the provision could be found in the bill which provides that parents or legal guardians may be consulted
553,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"at the proper time, she would be open to accept an amendment on Section 5 that would allow and specify the participation of parents or legal guardians of the child or minor."
558,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,a specific example of a medical or psychological examination which determine or alters a person’s SOGIE
561,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"one of the most traumatic examples would be related to what is called the use of “electric conversion therapy,” or applying electric shock in the belief that electricity can biologically change gender identity. the psychological and medical premise of this kind of a therapy is that the child’s SOGIE which may not be what was assigned to him/her at birth is different from his/her actual orientation so the child’s identity or expression is diagnosed as a disorder."
571,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,if the reason for putting the family courts first before the parents or guardians was that the latter do not usually accept the child’s preferred gender
575,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"hoped that with the passing of time, along with the support from gender sensitivity and equality advocates including the LGBTQ community, more families would slowly be more accepting. Section 5(i) requires express approval from parents or legal guardians first and only provided a contrary option in the event that the parents or legal guardians would force the child to undergo traumatic therapies, in which case the family court would provide the child a safe place to be heard, alongside the testimony of the parents. She said that based on the Rules of Court, parents and guardians are called as a matter of course for family court proceedings which, like all existing laws, are not amended nor affected by the bill"

Such option, would provide a space where both the child and his/ her parents or legal guardians would be heard equally and their issue would be resolved by the family court."
600,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"the concept is “touchy” because if the parent or guardian would like the child to undergo a certain procedure to determine his/her gender, the family court’s permission must be secured first"
605,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression whether as an LGBTQ or straight, is inherent to a person’s life as a human being. She averred that SOGIE is not only a matter of choice but a matter of realization of who and how a person is, even of a minor. because of human consciousness, even a two-year-old child is capable of naming experiences of who he/she is, how he/she relates with other people, and even remembering his/her experience until he/she reaches adolescence. with every period of human development, the child becomes aware of who he/she is and of his/her relationship with other people. even at two years old, the child starts to become verbal and capable to name and assign meanings as well as to remember experiences."
626,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"how the concept works when a five-year old boy, for instance, acted like a girl and his parents tried a scientific procedure to alter his thinking"
629,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,she would have to work it out through the IRR inasmuch as the electric conversion therapy she earlier gave as an example must be done by named accountable professionals to ensure that the family will go through the process in the family court first alongside social workers. electric conversion therapy causes damaging and irreversible trauma that impair the child’s vulnerability.
638,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,when the electric conversion therapy reached the Philippines
640,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,that there is no data regarding psychological therapies because of its deep stigma of bringing the child to a psychologist or psychiatrist to cure him/her of a SOGIE which is different from what was assigned to him/her at birth there were repeated reports especially from the LGBTQ communities that the impact is very deep and that there is no mechanism to protect them from the acts of their own parents.

670,1.6,2/8/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,the reason family courts were contemplated was that there have been cases where the parents came first but themselves requested therapists to apply electrical conversion therapy for their children documentation thereof is hard to present because the people involved do not want to reveal themselves
677,1.6,2/8/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"thanked Senator Hontiveros for availing of the intervention of family courts, adding that he is the principal author of Republic Act No. 8369 which created the Family Courts.

Specifically on the issue of academic freedom the case of Ateneo de Manila University vs. Capulong wherein the Court held that “private schools have the right to establish reasonable rules and regulations for the admission, discipline and promotion of children”; while on the right of the Court to supervise and regulate the practice of law, he cited Rule 11.01 of the Lawyer’s Code of Professional Responsibilities which directs a lawyer to appear in court in proper attire."

As regards the issue on school uniforms. while educate institutions and offices are allowed to maintain uniforms and dress codes to serve as an identifier for their members to highlight their different roles as well as serve as a safety requirement, the requirements of uniforms and dress codes should be consistent with the gender identity or gender expression of the student or employee. For instance, the Far Eastern University (FEU) has recently allowed its enrollees to wear the uniforms that they are most comfortable with, and she believed that this is expected to create a more inclusive environment where students can be more comfortable with themselves and which, in turn, would allow them to excel in their studies. the school should be able to accommodate the gender that their transgender students identify with in the interest of their welfare and happiness."

As regards cross dress nobody should be constrained from expressing his/ her character especially the way he/she dresses, and the bill addresses all forms of discrimination and violence on the basis of SOGIE of every person including one’s clothing style. the proposed measure was prompted by cases of discrimination that were documented by the advocates who were against discrimination including the LGBTIQ community although sadly, discrimination and abuse is continuously occurring on some individuals particularly the LGBTIQ mainly because their SOGIE was reflected in the clothes they wear."

As regards the claim that Pemberton physically assaulted and killed Jennifer because he was surprised to learn her true identity the “trans-panic” defense has been discredited in the US, hence it cannot be accepted as basis to lessen the punishment or pardon of the accused. Jennifer Laude remained true to her sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. transgender panic defense was never an acceptable defense for crimes like physical injuries or murder.

On the matter of comfort rooms, schools, employers, establishments and government agencies should be reminded that comfort rooms are meant to provide comfort; it is a place wherein an individual should be comfortable to express himself/ herself there is no evidence of a transwoman harassing another woman in bathrooms and that males who will dress as women to harass women inside bathrooms are neither encouraged nor protected by the bill because the males are not expressing their gender identity. as earlier mentioned, acts of harassment remain to be punished as acts of lasciviousness or sexual harassment, as the case may be. it would be absurd to think that in the absence of evidence, a man would cross dress and enter a woman’s comfort room with the intent of harassing a woman transgender people also need to feel comfortable in comfort rooms. there are already gender-neutral bathrooms in the country which can be accessed by individuals whatever their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. On the matter of fraud it is a function of a criminal mind and not a function of sexual orientation, the latter being a natural and positive aspect of an individual in accordance to God’s creation. appreciation to the points made by Senators Pacquiao and Sotto she would go back to her research and look into data, information or evidence that would show incidents of sexual assault or abuse committed in gender-neutral toilets."

1359,1.61,2/13/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,concern that the bill could be looked at as class legislation only in favor of SOGIE should it not apply to a straight man who wishes to enter a restaurant wearing only a “wifebeater” shirt.
1364,1.61,2/13/2017,interpellation,Drilon,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,"whether it would be a violate of the proposed measure if a SOGIE is not allowed entry to a certain establishment because of a dress code where or how one draws the line in case of refusal or denial of entry in an establishment on account of dress code or sexual orientation, gender identity and expression."
1371,1.61,2/13/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Drilon,In Favor,In Favor,"there is a clear difference between dress code standards — formal, semi-formal, casual - and the exercise of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression in the cases ofInday Garutay and BB Gandanghari, they followed the formal dress code but were nonetheless denied entry because of cross dress which is a form of discrimination against SOGIE. would be wrong if a dress code discriminates a class of people, for instance, when asking a Muslim woman to take off her veil, especially as it is an expression of her religion and spirituality."
1385,1.61,2/13/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"the need to find a good balance in implementing the measure. cautioned that the law might discriminate against others on account of social class or for other reasons, like in cases of dress codes and in connection with sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. for example that if he were a SOGIE and he entered the Sta. Elena Golf and Country Club with collarless shirt and he was removed from the establishment, then he can file an anti-discriminatory act against the establishment based on the bill once it becomes a law; on the other hand, if he is not a SOGIE and the club removed him because he was wearing a collarless shirt, he could not do anything but leave."
1401,1.61,2/13/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"if the club has a dress code that prohibits collarless shirt both for the SOGIE and straight, then it is fine. It is when distinctions are made based on SOGIE, she said, that discrimination exists."
1406,1.61,2/13/2017,interpellation,Sotto,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,problem in the case of Inday Garutay and BB Gandanghari was that the establishment thought that the dress code for women should not be worn by men.
1410,1.61,2/13/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Sotto,Against,Against,"the wearing of formal, semi-formal or casual dresses goes across the issue of whether one is SOGIE, straight or otherwise it is when distinctions are made based on SOGIE that discrimination exists"

Geraldine Roman of Bataan, would come to the Senate cross dress. nobody would stop Representative Roman from doing it because it is his sense of expression."
1432,1.61,2/13/2017,interpellation,Drilon,In Favor,Hontiveros,In Favor,In Favor,it is not a question of cross dress but of whether or not a straight person or a transgender who is not following the dress code will be treated similarly. it is not a question of prohibiting transdressing but it is a question of similar treatment to people similarly situated

1558,1.69,3/1/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Villanueva,Against,Against,"all human rights are equal in value to each other and are equally protected in the bill. Freedom ofreligion, she emphasized, will continue to be upheld in the bill, as well as human rights protection which never negates the exercise of religion freedom. CBCP president Archbishop Socrates Villegas’ March 3, 2015 statement pointing out that passing an anti-discrimination law is going to be a gesture of charity of Christian love, that priests must care for all, including the LGBT community, that Catholic schools are instructed to implement a zero tolerance policy against bullying ofgender non-conforming students, and parents are warned against imbuing hate against LGBT in their children. according to Archbishop Villegas, discrimination does not conform with Pope Francis’s vision of the Church as the sacrament of divine mercy and compassion, that it is contrary to the gospel spirit, and that verbal and physical violence against LGBT is an offense against God. the Colorado Civil Rights Division in Colorado, USA ruled that a bakery establishment, the Masterpiece Bakery, committed discrimination by refusing to provide an LGBT couple a cake for an event, for the couple’s ceremony because according to the Colorado Civil Rights Division, while religion freedom is important, no one’s religion beliefs make it acceptable to break the law by discriminating against prospective customers, that no one was asking the Masterpiece Bakery owner to change his beliefs, but that treating gay people differently because of who they are is plain and simple discrimination. there are important and practicable distinctions in everyday life that are made in continuing to uphold religion freedom and at the same time prohibiting and penalizing discrimination against members of the public or customers who happen to be of a different SOGIE or whose belief differ from the business owner."
1600,1.69,3/1/2017,interpellation,Villanueva,Against,Hontiveros,In Favor,Against,"he has a hard time understanding how the bill supports promotion of the freedom of religion because earlier. Senator Hontiveros said that the bill respects religion freedom but in the example given, the bakeshop owner was penalized for exercising his religion belief particularly about marriage, when he refused to sell a cake for a celebration of the union of a couple with the same sex or gender."
1609,1.69,3/1/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Villanueva,Against,Against,"the plaint of one of the men who tried to order the cake was that “being denied service by Masterpiece Cake Shop was offensive and dehumanizing especially in the midst ofarranging what should be a Joyful family celebration.” the measure does not even think that the aforementioned example would happen. the measure does not seek to grant new or special additional rights to any person, whatever his or her SOGIE, including LGBT, nor does it include same sex marriage. the cake vendor incident is an important example because it provides a distinction between the bakeshop owner exercising his religion belief and the bakeshop whose core business is to serve, give equal accommodations and services to their customers or give access or use ofsuch facility without any discrimination. In the Philippine setting, she stated that a person would continue to be free to live out their spirituality or religion in his/her personal life but must at the same time be able to live up to and be accountable for the obligations as a different entity such as a commercial establishment."

1657,1.69,3/1/2017,reply to interpellation,Hontiveros,In Favor,Villanueva,Against,Against,the act ofdenying a service on the basis ofSOGIE constitutes a discriminatory act that is prohibited under the bill. it is the nature ofa business to commit to offer its services to the public as a whole.

She believed that it is also time to protect the LGBTIQ comprehensive bill, standing alone and employing protective frameworks in that one law, might not be effective enough for the protection ofthe LGBTIQ who are sought to be embraced by protection from discriminatory acts, which the bill seeks to provide."
